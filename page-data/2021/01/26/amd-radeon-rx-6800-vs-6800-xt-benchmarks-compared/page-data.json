But how create they review efficiency-wise and which one might per chance additionally quiet you be conscious of buying for once they lastly come lend a hand in stock? To aid acknowledge that seek info from, I&#8217;ve set apart collectively some beautiful bar graphs of my 1080p, 1440p and 4K benchmark results, showing you exactly how they stack up across the whole well-known resolutions. </p>\n<p>Admittedly, both the RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT are bought out nearly in every single build for the time being, making them as stressful to bewitch as Nvidia&#8217;s equally unique RTX 30 series. I shall be evaluating AMD&#8217;s unique RX 6000 playing cards to Nvidia&#8217;s RTX 30 series in a separate article, but for now I wanted to point of curiosity on how AMD&#8217;s unique playing cards review, and whether or no longer the £620 / $650 RX 6800 XT is de facto rate all that extra money over the £530 / $580 RX 6800.</p>\n<p>To check the RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT, I paired them with my customary Intel Core i5-10600Ok processor and 16GB of Corsair Vengeance LED RAM, and set apart them head to transfer in my suite of graphics benchmarks, taking a median physique rate from their very like constructed-in benchmark instruments or from my like repeatable manual gameplay assessments. The games encompass a combine of blockbusters from the final couple of years: Shadow Of The Tomb Raider, Total War: Three Kingdoms, Closing Memoir XV, Monster Hunter: World, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, The Witcher 3, Metro Exodus and Regulate. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve additionally outmoded AMD&#8217;s versions of the RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT, as these had been the playing cards I outmoded for my respective GPU opinions. I ran both playing cards at their default clock speeds as neatly, so the figures below might per chance additionally quiet be rather representative of what yow will discover on varied kinds of RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT playing cards made by third occasion producers. I&#8217;ve additionally kept ray tracing switched off for this particular comparability check, as I shall be taking a more in-depth glimpse at next-gen ray tracing efficiency across the whole unique AMD and Nvidia GPUs in a dedicated comparability part. </p>\n<h2>AMD Radeon RX 6800 vs 6800 XT: 1080p benchmarks</h2>\n<p>Clearly, neither the RX 6800 or RX 6800 are going to warfare playing games at <strong>1920&#215;1080</strong> for the foreseeable future, as even the RX 6800 is proper of hitting at least 100fps on max settings right here, whereas the RX 6800 XT is in overall pushing 120fps. Of route, that is never any longer frequently aesthetic given how costly they are, and most frequently the RX 6800 XT has a first rate lead on its non-XT sibling. </p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"A bar graph comparing the 1080p performance of AMD's Radeon RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT.\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2021/01/AMD-RX-6800-vs-6800-XT-1080p-benchmarks.jpg\" width=\"985\"></img></p>\n<p>That said, there are just a few games the build the RX 6800 is never any longer that a ways in the lend a hand of the RX 6800 XT. In Closing Memoir XV, I most attention-grabbing noticed a distinction of around 5fps between each and every card, as an illustration, and Regulate was once even nearer at factual 3fps. I suspect right here is doubtless because of the the RX 6800 XT being tiny by my CPU in these particular cases, as I noticed a extraordinarily the same stutter happen with these particular games in my RTX 3060 Ti vs RTX 3070 comparability article as neatly. </p>\n<p>When you happen to&#8217;re coping with extremely efficient graphics playing cards love this at 1920&#215;1080, any doable bottlenecks are nearly no doubt going to be associated to your CPU in resolution to your GPU at this resolution, and it will fetch a aesthetic amount of distinction to your PC’s overall efficiency. As such, you might per chance potentially glimpse better efficiency from the RX 6800 XT at 1080p in the event you pair it with a more extremely efficient processor, akin to one of Intel&#8217;s Core i7s or AMD&#8217;s Ryzen 7 chips.</p>\n<h2>AMD Radeon RX 6800 vs 6800 XT: 1440p benchmarks</h2>\n<p>Unruffled, as extremely efficient as currently&#8217;s graphics playing cards are, bumping up the resolution to <strong>2560&#215;1440</strong> quiet places the burden squarely lend a hand onto your GPU, making CPU bottlenecks grand more no longer going. AMD&#8217;s two RX 6000 playing cards are quiet extremely proper on this department, despite the indisputable fact that, with the RX 6800 hitting lastly 75-80fps in currently&#8217;s kindly blockbusters, whereas the RX 6800 XT is hitting at least 90fps.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"A bar graph comparing the 1440p performance of AMD's Radeon RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT.\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2021/01/AMD-RX-6800-vs-6800-XT-1440p-benchmarks.jpg\" width=\"985\"></img></p>\n<p>Again, there are exceptions to this rule. Regulate all all over again noticed a nigh-on identical moderate physique rate from both playing cards &#8211; despite the indisputable fact that the RX 6800 XT does pull forward whereas you swap on the game&#8217;s ray tracing give a do away with to. For basically the most section, despite the indisputable fact that, there might per chance be a sure gap between these two playing cards, with the RX 6800 XT leading by around 10-15fps reckoning on the title. </p>\n<p>Of route, except you like a excessive refresh rate show screen, choosing the RX 6800 XT might per chance additionally no longer fetch you any abet in any respect, as monitors with a ragged 60Hz refresh rate will conceal the same 60fps no matter which card&#8217;s interior your PC. Certainly, even in the event you create like a excessive refresh rate show screen that goes above 60Hz, I am no longer particular I would possibly be ready to repeat the adaptation between 80 and 90fps without the abet of a physique rate counter. I&#8217;d factual about be ready to repeat apart between 105fps and shut to 130fps in something love The Witcher III, as an illustration, but 80-90fps is all grand of a muchness to my eyes. In consequence, it will per chance perchance be rate sticking with the out of the ordinary RX 6800 in the event you&#8217;re planning to play games at 1440p, as I am no longer particular you&#8217;re in actuality getting a hundred quid&#8217;s rate of extra efficiency right here.</p>\n<h2>AMD Radeon RX 6800 vs 6800 XT: 4K benchmarks</h2>\n<p>When you happen to&#8217;re aiming to play games at <strong>4K</strong>, on the other hand, you then&#8217;re positively going to fetch so a lot more out of the RX 6800 XT. Admittedly, neither card is de facto match for 60fps on max settings at this resolution, as you might presumably additionally glimpse from the bar chart below. The RX 6800 XT presents it a rather proper shot, hitting 60fps in rather grand the whole lot but two games on max settings, but there are quiet cases the build it falls down nearer to the 40-50fps des<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a>ate, akin to in Total War: Three Kingdoms and Monster Hunter: World.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"A bar graph comparing the 4K Ultra settings performance of AMD's Radeon RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT graphics cards.\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2021/01/AMD-RX-6800-vs-6800-XT-4K-ultra-benchmarks.jpg\" width=\"985\"></img></p>\n<p>The RX 6800 XT additionally struggles with Regulate on max settings (despite the indisputable fact that given its max settings are technically called &#8216;Excessive&#8217;, I&#8217;ve included them in the chart below to steer sure of misunderstanding). Right here, the RX 6800 XT managed a median of factual 45fps, which is quiet factual about playable, but it be very grand on the borderline of what I&#8217;d name an appropriate physique rate. </p>\n<p>In varied locations on Excessive settings, on the other hand, the RX 6800 XT does set apart in quite an spectacular efficiency over its non-XT sibling. With the exception of Regulate, the RX 6800 XT delivers speeds neatly in way over 60fps right here, all all over again leading by 10-12fps over the RX 6800. Admittedly, the latter can additionally quiet factual about hit a median of 60fps in most of my benchmark games on Excessive, but there is now not any denying you might per chance fetch smoother overall physique charges by choosing the XT right here.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"A bar graph comparing the 4K High settings performance of AMD's Radeon RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT graphics cards.\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2021/01/AMD-RX-6800-vs-6800-XT-4K-high-benchmarks.jpg\" width=\"985\"></img></p>\n<p>In Assassin&#8217;s Creed Valhalla, as an illustration, the RX 6800 hit a low of 42fps in its constructed-in benchmark versus the 6800 XT&#8217;s low of 49fps, whereas Closing Memoir XV noticed the RX 6800 hit lows of 48fps, which is kind of 10fps below the RX 6800 XT&#8217;s low of 56fps. It be a the same picture across varied games, too, with the RX 6800 dipping grand decrease than the XT. In consequence, the extra horsepower you fetch with the RX 6800 XT will aid push those minimum physique charges up grand nearer to a more consistent 60fps, making it grand more doubtless that you would raise on playing games at this roughly quality surroundings in the years to come lend a hand. </p>\n<p>Whack the standard down to Medium, on the other hand, and the XT&#8217;s efficiency bump starts to severely change less evident all all over again. It quiet has around a 10fps lead on its non-XT sibling right here, now and all all over again reaching nearer to 15-20fps, but with excessive refresh rate monitors quiet being slightly scarce at 4K, you&#8217;re more liable to hit the 60fps threshold on both playing cards right here, negating that extra lead supplied by the XT.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"A bar graph comparing the 4K Medium settings performance of AMD's Radeon RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT graphics cards.\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2021/01/AMD-RX-6800-vs-6800-XT-4K-medium-benchmarks.jpg\" width=\"985\"></img></p>\n<p>Of route, you might presumably dispute the same regarding the RX 6800 XT&#8217;s speeds on Top quality settings, and there is some fact in that. Nonetheless, as I said above, if playing games as conclude to 60fps is serious to you, then the RX 6800 XT is a ways more liable to create those sorts of physique charges on Excessive than the non-XT version. On Medium, despite the indisputable fact that, the RX 6800 has bigger than adequate energy to hit a consistent 60fps at 4K &#8211; despite the indisputable fact that as Regulate all all over again proves, there will quiet be the out of the ordinary sport accessible that taxes both playing cards equally, no matter quality surroundings.</p>\n<h2>AMD Radeon RX 6800 vs 6800 XT: conclusion</h2>\n<p>Overall, then, it guarantee that both the RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT are both incredibly extremely efficient graphics playing cards, proper of filling out excessive refresh rate monitors at both 1080p and 1440p, and hitting consistent 60fps physique charges on Medium to Excessive settings at 4K. Nonetheless, whereas the RX 6800 XT is clearly the sooner card of the 2, I&#8217;d potentially err on the facet of the out of the ordinary RX 6800 as being the better label card overall. </p>\n<p>At 1080p and 1440p, I am factual no longer convinced you are going to secret agent the extra efficiency supplied by the XT at these resolutions, at least no longer when it involves raw efficiency. Naturally, the RX 6800 XT&#8217;s sooner physique charges create prove to be helpful whereas you starting up up throwing ray tracing into the combine, especially in the event you could want to play games at 1440p. For the time being, the RX 6800 can create ray tracing at 60fps no stutter at 1080p, but bump the resolution as a lot as 1440p and also you&#8217;re taking a check at physique charges nearer to 45fps with the head RT settings enabled. The RX 6800 XT, on the a lot of hand, would possibly quiet warfare to hit 60fps at 1440p with maxed out ray tracing, but its smoother 55fps moderate physique charges are quiet rather darn conclude. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_928799\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"A side-on photo of the AMD Radeon RX 6800 graphics card on top of the RX 6800 XT.\" height=\"681\" src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2021/01/AMD-Radeon-RX-6800-vs-6800-XT-side-1212x681.jpg\" width=\"1212\"></img><figcaption>The RX 6800 (top) is precisely the same dimension because the RX 6800 XT (below), factual reasonably thinner.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Nonetheless, this stutter will doubtless change once AMD starting up their uPComing DLSS competitor tech, FidelityFX Clean Resolution &#8211; despite the indisputable fact that whether or no longer it shall be as proper at boosting each and every card&#8217;s efficiency as Nvidia&#8217;s DLSS tech stays to be seen. As I talked about vibrant at the head of this text, I shall be doing a separate ray tracing comparability part with all of currently&#8217;s next-gen graphics playing cards very rapidly, so leer out for that to fetch an even bigger thought of how issues stack up.</p>\n<p>Needless to utter, ray tracing at 4K is rather grand out of the seek info from on these playing cards vibrant now, but even in the event you&#8217;re factual taking a check to bewitch a 4K card in same outdated, I&#8217;d potentially quiet facet with the RX 6800 right here, if most attention-grabbing attributable to at the same time as you starting up up hitting the £600 / $650 des<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a>ate, you might presumably as neatly decide for Nvidia&#8217;s RTX 3080 in resolution to AMD&#8217;s RX 6800 XT at this resolution.
