That this company with a completely mature theory of gamers have been truly going at hand out £30,000 to any individual to enact totally nothing for a year apart from play some video games on an OPSYS PC from the comfort of their very bear dwelling?</p>\n<p>And what does it accumulate out of this odd competition in another case.
