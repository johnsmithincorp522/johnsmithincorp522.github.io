Create of. Whereas they&#8217;ll also simply not be in the market to capture as standalone GPUs, Intel savor announced that they&#8217;ve at final started transport them to scheme builders worldwide for use in entry-stage desktop PCs.</p>\n<p>I have been ready for the originate of Intel&#8217;s Xe GPUs ever since we got our first glimpse of them at CES 2020. Abet then, it was as soon as Intel&#8217;s DG1 prototype that took centre stage, and right this moment&#8217;s preliminary slash of Iris Xe graphics cards are basically basically based off that very identical invent.</p>\n<p>Outwardly, they watch pretty assorted from Intel&#8217;s first prototype. Up to now, two models savor been confirmed: the one confirmed up top there, which has been made by Asus, and one other altogether bluer version pictured beneath made by Vibrant. Or not it is not but obvious whether we are going to seek for extra manufacturers originate their savor Iris Xe cards in the coming months, but given basically the most up-to-date shortages of PC hardware in total right this moment, or not it is customarily gorgeous that Intel are commencing minute somewhat making a massive splash.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"A photo of Intel's first DG1 Xe graphics card\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-lazyload=\"true\" src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/intel%20xe%20graphics%20card%20blue.jpg/BROK/resize/660%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/intel%20xe%20graphics%20card%20blue.jpg\" ></img><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>It looks to be a somewhat modest originate all round, as Intel stutter their first pair of Iris Xe graphics cards will contain acceptable 4GB of memory, putting them very powerful at the lower-cease of the graphics card spectrum. They&#8217;re going to moreover savor 80 execution devices (Intel&#8217;s similar of Nvidia&#8217;s CUDA cores and AMD&#8217;s movement processors), which is truly pretty bit beneath the highest 96 EU spec that Intel previously outlined as piece of their over-arching Xe-LP (or low energy) micro architecture. As for the rest of their specs, info are quiet thin on the flooring for the time being.</p>\n<p>Certainly, the single other objects of knowledge Intel savor confirmed to this point is that the cards will savor three demonstrate outputs, as successfully as toughen for hardware video decode and encode accerlation (alongside side AV1 decode toughen), adaptive sync and Repeat HDR. They&#8217;re going to moreover savor some level of AI capability thanks to Intel&#8217;s DP4a deep-studying inference tech, but in any other case that&#8217;s your lot.</p>\n<p>We fabricate not know when these Xe-powered OEM programs will originate to head on sale but, both, but I imagine we are going to seek for them cropping up over the next couple of months as scheme builders originate to receive their shipments through. I will be  to seem exactly what form of PCs they cease up in as successfully. Intel stutter they&#8217;re at showcase concentrating on &#8220;mainstream users and minute- and medium-size companies&#8221; with these first two Iris Xe cards, but with so exiguous recordsdata to head on right this moment or not it is laborious to say whether or not they&#8217;ll be ethical rivals to other low-cease GPUs, equivalent to Nvidia&#8217;s GeForce GTX 1650 or AMD&#8217;s Radeon RX 5500 XT. We&#8217;ll acceptable savor to wait and seek for.</p>\n</p></div>\n</p></div>\n","title":"Intel have finally launched their first Xe graphics cards","date":"January 26, 2021","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"intel-have-finally-launched-their-first-xe-graphics-cards","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='400'%20height='225'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20225'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'%3e%3cpath%20d='M251%205l7%207%206%208-7-7c-7-6-10-8-10-6l3%203%202%204-3-3c-4-4-7-4-3%200%202%203%201%203-2%201-7-5-3%200%206%2010l10%2010-12-10c-9-9-12-11-12-9l10%2011%2010%2011-10-10-10-8-1%202%205%207c4%203%206%206%205%206l-8-7-8-8c-2%200%200%203%206%2010%205%204%208%208%207%208l-8-8c-6-5-9-8-10-7l10%2012%2010%2011-11-11-12-11c-3%200%202%205%2025%2028a438%20438%200%2001-29-26c-3%200%203%207%2037%2040a1052%201052%200%2001-41-36c-1%200%202%204%209%2010l9%2010-11-9c-6-7-10-10-11-9l2%203c3%204%202%204-2%201s-4-4-4-1c0%201%2011%2013%2025%2026a497%20497%200%2001-29-24l13%2015%2013%2013-15-13c-11-11-15-15-15-13%200%201%202%204%205%206l4%205-6-4c-4-5-6-6-7-5s2%205%2013%2015l14%2016-15-15c-12-11-16-15-16-13l6%208%206%206-8-6-8-7c-1%201%200%202%201%203%202%202%201%203-1%202-3-2-3-2-3%200-1%201%202%204%208%2010%2012%2013%2012%2014%200%202l-10-8c-1%201-1%201-3-1l-3-1%201%201%2059%2063%2015%2016-7%204c-6%204-7%205-8%204-5-7-75-80-75-79-1%200%200%202%2039%2044a760%20760%200%2001-32-29l31%2035a1038%201038%200%2001-40-37l7%206v1l36%2039c22%2024%2025%2028%2023%2028a710%20710%200%2001-57-60c-1%200-6-5-5-6l-2-3-2-1%201%202v1l45%2051%2017%2019c-1%200-4-2-16-16-38-42-45-49-45-47-1%201%207%2010%2028%2033l29%2033c-1%201%201%202-39-41a487%20487%200%2000-40-41c-5-4%203%204%2034%2039a43577%2043577%200%200140%2045%201513%201513%200%2001-33%2022%206859%206859%200%2000-70-81l-6-7-8%204c-6%203-7%204-8%203-3-2-15%205-16%208%200%204%201%205%203%204l2-1-2%203c-4%202-4%206-1%206%202%200%203-1%203-2%200-4%205-7%205-3l2%201h3l2%202a402%20402%200%200157%2075c8%2011%2010%2012%2012%2012%202-1%203-1%202%201%200%202%202%205%204%205%201-1%204%201%206%205l8%207%205%205c3%204%204%204%205%200%201-2%201-3-1-5l-5-10-4-7%205-3c5-4%205-6%202-9-4-3-4-3%206-9%2010-7%2010-7%2013-2%204%204%204%204%209%200l4-3-3-3-3-5c0-2%203-1%207%203%203%204%205%205%205%204h1c-1%203%201%203%206-1%206-4%206-3%203-7s-2-5%201-1l4%203%2010-7a22209%2022209%200%200157-40l-3-3-2-4%202%202%203%202%205-3c5-3%206-4%205-6%200-3-2-3-5-2-2%201-5%200-5-2l12-9c12-8%2013-10%2011-11-2%200-2-2-1-2l3-3c1-3%205%200-43-44-29-29-34-32-34-30M127%20131c-2%202-2%202%205%209l3%205c2%203%204%204%206%201%202-2%202-2-2-6l-7-7c-2-3-3-3-5-2m25%2028c-4%202-6-1%2018%2028l7-4-22-26-3%202m-15%2011c-2%201-1%202%209%2014l9%2010%201-1c4%202%203-1-2-7l-15-17-2%201'%20fill='%23d3d3d3'%20fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e","aspectRatio":1.7730496453900708,"src":"/static/33627d6634052d87fb206cff2ddc919d/a9708/24426-intel-have-finally-launched-their-first-xe-graphics-cards.jpg","srcSet":"/static/33627d6634052d87fb206cff2ddc919d/84d81/24426-intel-have-finally-launched-their-first-xe-graphics-cards.jpg 250w,\n/static/33627d6634052d87fb206cff2ddc919d/f0719/24426-intel-have-finally-launched-their-first-xe-graphics-cards.jpg 500w,\n/static/33627d6634052d87fb206cff2ddc919d/a9708/24426-intel-have-finally-launched-their-first-xe-graphics-cards.jpg 880w","sizes":"(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px"}}}}}},"previous":{"uri":"/2021/01/26/scavengers-studio-creative-director-accused-of-belittling-and-harassing-employees/","title":"Scavengers Studio creative director accused of belittling and harassing employees"},"next":{"uri":"/2021/01/26/resident-evil-village-will-release-in-may-comes-with-re-verse-multiplayer-game/","title":"Resident Evil Village will release in May, comes with RE: Verse multiplayer game"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyNDQyNg==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyNDQyMw==","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoyNDQ1Ng=="}},"staticQueryHashes":["104267996","1682016598","848497233"]}
