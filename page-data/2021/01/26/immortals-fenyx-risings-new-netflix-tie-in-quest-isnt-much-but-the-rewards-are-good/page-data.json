This time, it’s with an inviting Netflix inform called <em>Blood of Zeus</em>. The added quest isn’t very correct, but it with out a doubt does bear some good rewards. However you’ll want to act almost as we teach to earn them.<br /></br></p>\n<p> It looks Ubisoft is terribly initiate to doing crossovers in <em>Immortals</em>. A few weeks aid, <em>Immortals </em>received an <span><em>Roam Time</em>-themed cosmetic pack</span>. Now, <em>Blood of Zeus</em> <span>has reach to <em>Immortals </em>for a restricted-time event</span>. The brand new quest is barely connected to the inviting TV inform, then yet again. You originate the quest, “A Tribute To Family,” at the Hall of Heroes. Ready there&#8217;s a ghostly warrior, utilizing the same model that’s been within the game since originate. He explains some stuff about blood, family, and sacrifices. I judge within the event you’ve considered the inform, which became once launched aid in October, his dialogue may maybe even be extra involving or foremost. I haven’t considered the inform, even when, so I correct type of nodded along. When he became once carried out, I ran off to break the 2 tall bosses.</p>\n<figure contenteditable=\"false\" data-format=\"png\" data-height=\"1080\" data-id=\"lulyfqqjc8qq7g4dyicw\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommend-id=\"image://lulyfqqjc8qq7g4dyicw\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-width=\"1920\" draggable=\"false\">\n<div contenteditable=\"false\" data-hidecredit=\"false\" data-imagerights=\"fair-use\" data-syndicationrights=\"true\">\n<p><span></p>\n<div>\n<p><img alt=\"Illustration for article titled iImmortals Fenyx Rising/is New Netflix Tie-In Quest Isnt Much, But The Rewards Are Good\" data-alt=\"Illustration for article titled iImmortals Fenyx Rising/is New Netflix Tie-In Quest Isnt Much, But The Rewards Are Good\" data-anim-src=\"http://kotaku.com/\" data-chomp-id=\"lulyfqqjc8qq7g4dyicw\" data-expanded- data-format=\"png\" data- draggable=\"auto\"  src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"></img></p>\n</div>\n<p></span></p><figcaption>Screenshot: Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></div>\n<p><span data-format=\"png\" data-height=\"1080\" data-id=\"lulyfqqjc8qq7g4dyicw\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommend-id=\"image://lulyfqqjc8qq7g4dyicw\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-width=\"1920\"></span></figure>\n<p>One is a Cerberus and the replace a Chimera, both enemies that exist already within the game. Finally, on my method to battle the Chimera boss I ran staunch into a random one chilling within the arena and killed it. Once they are unimaginative, I took the 2 objects they dropped—some blood and a blue rose—and headed to a Zeus shrine. After a transient, dialogue-free cutscene, the quest became once over. The complete thing took about five minutes.<br /></br></p>\n<p>It’s a uncommon crossover, one which hasn’t given me any extra curiosity in looking out at <em>Blood of Zeus</em>. (I even needed to bear a look at up what the inform even became once for the rationale that quest didn’t inform me s<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a>ificant.) <em>Blood of Zeus</em> has a tenuous <em>Immortals</em> connection due to one of many train actors on the inform, <span>Elia Toufexis</span>, can be the train at the aid of Prometheus, one of many predominant characters in <em>Immortals</em>. However that’s never mentioned or played with in any appreciate.</p>\n<div>\n<div data-inset-category=\"CommerceInsetMobile\" data-inset-url=\"https://sidedeal.com/deals/2-pack-juku-steam-coding-kits?affiliate=5e9630cd2c61980cb0a26c4e\">\n<p>G/O Media can even earn a rate</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<figure contenteditable=\"false\" data-format=\"png\" data-height=\"1080\" data-id=\"pe3rm2abn1pkdlrzktwo\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommend-id=\"image://pe3rm2abn1pkdlrzktwo\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-width=\"1920\" draggable=\"false\">\n<div contenteditable=\"false\" data-hidecredit=\"false\" data-imagerights=\"fair-use\" data-syndicationrights=\"true\">\n<p><span></p>\n<div>\n<p><img alt=\"Illustration for article titled iImmortals Fenyx Rising/is New Netflix Tie-In Quest Isnt Much, But The Rewards Are Good\" data-alt=\"Illustration for article titled iImmortals Fenyx Rising/is New Netflix Tie-In Quest Isnt Much, But The Rewards Are Good\" data-anim-src=\"http://kotaku.com/\" data-chomp-id=\"pe3rm2abn1pkdlrzktwo\" data-expanded- data-format=\"png\" data- draggable=\"auto\"  src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"></img></p>\n</div>\n<p></span></p><figcaption>Screenshot: Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></div>\n<p><span data-format=\"png\" data-height=\"1080\" data-id=\"pe3rm2abn1pkdlrzktwo\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommend-id=\"image://pe3rm2abn1pkdlrzktwo\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-width=\"1920\"></span></figure>\n<p>On the other hand, I indifferent suggest of us boot up <em>Immortals </em>and play this restricted-time quest.

You furthermore mght earn a new face and hairdo, and even earn 300 Electrum, a top rate currency. Serious about you fair earn 30 a pop from each day quests, here is  bit of free false money. If you’re keen on <em>Blood of Zeus</em>, there’s a new cosmetic pack within the retailer, which isn’t time-restricted. So whereas the complete thing didn’t wow me, it’s rate trying out for the rewards.</p>\n<p><span><em>The Blood of Zeus</em> crossover quest</span> is playable within the game until January 28 on all platforms. </p>\n<p>  .</p>\n<h2 id=\"h161482\">Linked Experiences</h2>\n</div>\n","title":"Immortals Fenyx Rising’s New Netflix Tie-In Quest Isn’t Much, But The Rewards Are Good","date":"January 26, 2021","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"immortals-fenyx-rising&#8217;s-new-netflix-tie-in-quest-isn&#8217;t-much,-but-the-rewards-are-good","localFile":{"childImageSharp":null}}}},"previous":{"uri":"/2021/01/26/heres-every-treasure-hoard-map-location-in-assassins-creed-valhalla/","title":"Here’s every Treasure Hoard map location in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla"},"next":{"uri":"/2021/01/26/super-mario-themed-animal-crossing-event-coming-in-march/","title":"Super Mario-themed Animal Crossing event coming in March"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyMzU4NQ==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyNDAwMw==","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoyMzQ0Mw=="}},"staticQueryHashes":["104267996","1682016598","848497233"]}
