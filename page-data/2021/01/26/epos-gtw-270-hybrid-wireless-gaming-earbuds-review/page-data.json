In and of themselves, there&#8217;s nothing inherently special about these Bluetooth earbuds; hell, the Razer Hammerheads were around for some time now. </p>\n<p>There could be a matter right here though: Bluetooth is a quite high-latency interface. That is superior for Spotify however now not so considerable for gaming the set each millisecond counts. The GTW 270 Hybrid differentiates itself from the competition by at the side of aptX low latency wireless by plot of a actual 2.4Ghz dongle on top of Bluetooth 5.1. Will this be enough to search out a set for the GTW 270 Hybrid in our finest gaming headset handbook?</p>\n<div>\n<p>EPOS GTW 270 Hyrbid specs</p>\n<p><strong>Kind: </strong> In-ear wireless<br /></br><strong>Frequency response: </strong> 20-20,000 Hz<br /></br><strong>Connection: </strong>aptX low-latency and Bluetooth 5.1<br /></br><strong>Battery: </strong> 5 hours on buds, 15 hours on case<br /></br><strong>Charging: </strong> 1.5 hours stout charge, 15min for 1 hour of listening<br /></br><strong>Charge: </strong> $199 (£179)</p>\n</div>\n<p>The GSA 70 USB Kind-C aptX low latency dongle is barely shrimp making it perfect for smartphones and the Nintendo Swap. Additionally, it in actuality works completely with PC&#8217;s, laptops, and even the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. EPOS affords a USB Kind-A converter cable for these gadgets that invent now not bear USB Kind-C ports too.</p>\n<p>The $200 GTW 270 comes in a superior, slim metallic case that holds an extra 15 hours of battery life. The buds themselves closing 5 hours per charge which suggests a whole of 20 hours altogether. And in a pinch, sparkling 15min in the case will salvage you an hour of audio on the streak. The slim rectangular box has a USB Kind-C port on the support for charging and on the front is a single button and cramped LED that charge battery and connection dwelling. </p>\n<p>Opening the case unearths the stout earbuds nestled in their cushty housing emblazoned with EPOS logo. They match surprisingly with ease in the ear and defend establish once effectively seated in set. The IPX5 ranking capacity they won&#8217;t die out of your sweat or light rain showers.</p>\n<p>Staunch ear match and seal is primary for the GTW 270 to relate rich, bassy sound in any other case, the audio shall be noticeably flat and tinny. I modified into once before every thing disquieted at how unsuitable they sounded after I first establish them in, however after I switched to better pointers, the sound improved radically. Unfortunately, the better pointers hurt my internal ear canal after a while however I had to soldier on to withhold the audio quality. I deem some folks can also strive in opposition to to search out a factual match with the bundled pointers. </p>\n<figure data-bordeaux-image-check=\"\">\n<div>\n<p><picture><source alt=\"EPOS GTS 270 Hybrid\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aoYHSs3c3ndWE8UJVsUGUX.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aoYHSs3c3ndWE8UJVsUGUX.jpg\" data- onerror=\"if(this.src &#038;&#038; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\"  type=\"image/webp\"></source><source alt=\"EPOS GTS 270 Hybrid\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aoYHSs3c3ndWE8UJVsUGUX.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aoYHSs3c3ndWE8UJVsUGUX.jpg\" data- onerror=\"if(this.src &#038;&#038; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\"  type=\"image/jpeg\"></source><img alt=\"EPOS GTS 270 Hybrid\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aoYHSs3c3ndWE8UJVsUGUX.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aoYHSs3c3ndWE8UJVsUGUX.jpg\" data- onerror=\"if(this.src &#038;&#038; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\"  src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\"></img></picture></p>\n</div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\"><span itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Whereas you resolve the GTW 270&#8217;s out of their case, they routinely energy on and join to either the dongle or Bluetooth however now not concurrently. This sounds like a missed quite loads of because it would possess sense to withhold these paired to a smartphone and a PC or console. Pairing with the USB dongle does now not require any work, however Bluetooth pairing is somewhat extra enthusiastic. The buds have to be inner the case followed by a protracted press of the case button to initiate pairing. </p>\n<p>Once connected to a USB procedure, the low latency works as marketed. I didn&#8217;t gaze a huge distinction between Bluetooth and low latency modes, to be honest. Alternatively, low-latency affords you EQ presets and 7.1 encompass sound via the EPOS Gaming Suite on PC. which does possess a noticeable distinction to the audio quality. </p>\n<figure data-bordeaux-image-check=\"\">\n<div>\n<p><picture><source alt=\"EPOS GTS 270 Hybrid\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ohZAhiRumCqp6TJSd5mhtX.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ohZAhiRumCqp6TJSd5mhtX.jpg\" data- onerror=\"if(this.src &#038;&#038; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\"  type=\"image/webp\"></source><source alt=\"EPOS GTS 270 Hybrid\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ohZAhiRumCqp6TJSd5mhtX.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ohZAhiRumCqp6TJSd5mhtX.jpg\" data- onerror=\"if(this.src &#038;&#038; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\"  type=\"image/jpeg\"></source><img alt=\"EPOS GTS 270 Hybrid\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ohZAhiRumCqp6TJSd5mhtX.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ohZAhiRumCqp6TJSd5mhtX.jpg\" data- onerror=\"if(this.src &#038;&#038; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\"  src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\"></img></picture></p>\n</div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\"><span itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>I veteran the GTW 270 every day for roughly two weeks, testing with a host of games, songs, and movies to study the overall audio efficiency. The sound is typical EPOS with warm tones that lean to a extra bassy sound. As a ways as earbuds streak, these are surely impressive. And because they are using sound straight into your ear, the buds nearly appear to move, as in case you&#8217;d also be paying consideration to dwell audio. </p>\n<p>In CyberPunk 2077, I modified into once impressed with how factual the soundstage is; the GTW 270 in actuality brings Night City to life. The electropunk soundtrack thrills with decent bass, while NPC conversations and ambient sounds plot via crystal certain—it in actuality feels comparable to you&#8217;d also be strolling these streets. Paying attention to music is factual too, though the bass modified into once repeatedly sparkling a tad vexed of being large.</p>\n<figure data-bordeaux-image-check=\"\">\n<div>\n<p><picture><source alt=\"EPOS GTS 270 Hybrid\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5njiCZEShRsKeZcKn6bqMW.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5njiCZEShRsKeZcKn6bqMW.jpg\" data- onerror=\"if(this.src &#038;&#038; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\"  type=\"image/webp\"></source><source alt=\"EPOS GTS 270 Hybrid\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5njiCZEShRsKeZcKn6bqMW.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5njiCZEShRsKeZcKn6bqMW.jpg\" data- onerror=\"if(this.src &#038;&#038; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\"  type=\"image/jpeg\"></source><img alt=\"EPOS GTS 270 Hybrid\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5njiCZEShRsKeZcKn6bqMW.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5njiCZEShRsKeZcKn6bqMW.jpg\" data- onerror=\"if(this.src &#038;&#038; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\"  src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\"></img></picture></p>\n</div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\"><span itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Maybe the ideal flaw with the GTW 270 is that you simply&#8217;d now not employ the microphone in low-latency mode. EPOS says it is a limitation of the aptX low latency which prioritizes playback channel handiest. Whereas you adore multiplayer games with your chums, you will bear to follow the slower Bluetooth. </p>\n<p>Alternatively, the mic itself is quite factual for earbuds. No topic a faint, audible background sing, the microphone does a large job of deciding on out my voice and rendering it clearly with my natural tone. It be positively factual enough to your mobile phone calls and sport chat. Here is a pattern: </p>\n<p>Total the EPOS GTW 270 is a thrilling fresh product that&#8217;s in particular excellent to mobile avid gamers who are looking out to swap between their smartphone, Nintendo Swap, and a PC. Alternatively, the reality that you simply&#8217;d now not employ the microphone when using the dongle is a big turn off for PC users which suggests you&#8217;d now not employ these to invent Zoom calls.
