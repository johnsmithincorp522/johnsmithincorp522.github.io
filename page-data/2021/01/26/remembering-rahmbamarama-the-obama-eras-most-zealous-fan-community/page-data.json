But every other felt impressed to jot down a extraordinarily transient fanfiction about Emanuel attempting to seduce Dwelling Speaker Nancy Pelosi. This used to be welcomed, even encouraged at the Livejournal neighborhood Rahmbamarama, a field the place Emanuel’s loudest and most ardent followers congregated within the future of the early years of the Obama administration to discuss White Dwelling files and publish horny photo dumps and smutty fanfiction featuring Emanuel and diversified Democratic Social gathering individuals and allies.<strong> </strong><br /></br></p>\n<p>Emanuel used to be identified as an enigmatic consultant for Bill Clinton earlier than serving as an Illinois Congressman from 2002 to 2009, when he formally became White Dwelling Chief of Workers. He used to be driven and, by Washington standards, used to be younger and not fully unattractive, which is all it takes to be swoon-expedient in American politics. (At some stage within the 2020 presidential marketing campa<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a>, Pete Buttigieg developed a appealing <span>fanfiction writing fanbase</span> for these comparable abilities.) Politics fandom ran on this sliver of desirability to an undeniably chaotic conclusion: drinking politics within the comparable manner one does celeb gossip, relating to biography as lore, and finding neighborhood within the absurdity of all of it. Nowhere used to be this more evident than at Rahmbamarama, a field the place fandom used to be fueled by uniquely Obama-period earnestness. </p>\n<p>“Who within the hell doesn’t worship Rahm?” intoned the subject line of a blog posted to Rahmbamarama within the neighborhood’s infancy. The blog continued: </p>\n<blockquote data-type=\"BlockQuote\">\n<p>My sister, who has never been inclined to provide a shit relating to the relaxation political—great to the disappointment of my political junkie heart—has fallen in worship with Rahm Emanuel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote data-type=\"BlockQuote\">\n<p>We determined that if he ran for President, his slogan wants to be: “Bringing BAMF encourage to The US”</p>\n<p>So, if Rahm Emanuel does trudge for President within the future, what halt you assume his slogan wants to be? RAHM EMANUEL WANTS YOUR MOTHERFUCKING IDEAS. HE NEEDS THEM.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Among the tags of the publish reads, “rahm emanuel doesn’t sleep. he waits.” One lady spoke back, “I’M TIRED OF THIS MOTHERFUCKING PARTISAN POLITICS IN THIS MOTHERFUCKING CONGRESS!” in a reference to the camp classic <em>Snakes on a Airplane</em>.</p>\n<p>From the spend of “BAMF,” (short for inappropriate-ass motherfucker for these of you who can not undergo in solutions that far within the past) to the Emanuel-fication of a <span>Chuck Norris meme</span>, it’s determined that this used to be the web of the late 2000s, when initiating a sentence with the LOLcat-impressed “can I haz” wasn’t regarded as deeply dorky.<strong> </strong>No decrease than, not on this pocket of Livejournal. By this time, Livejournal used to be largely a haven for fandom divulge, vogue devotees, and purveyors of tawdry celeb rumors. After a few years, great of Livejournal’s terminally online userbase would congregate to Tumblr and Twitter, leaving the Livejournal period—the blogs, the communities, the drama—at the encourage of. But earlier than Livejournal’s reputation petered out fully, the early years of the Obama administration began, and with it came the initiating of Rahmbamarama, the place fandom nerds and wannabe wonks collided. There’s a publish titled “Nate Silver is my sapiosexual lust object.” What this neighborhood used to be about and who it used to be for used to be never in point of fact a mystery.</p>\n<figure contenteditable=\"false\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-height=\"1396\" data-id=\"jhkfwkujtkt9vhbnq7gm\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jhkfwkujtkt9vhbnq7gm\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-width=\"1690\" draggable=\"false\">\n<div contenteditable=\"false\" data-hidecredit=\"false\" data-imagerights=\"other-license\" data-syndicationrights=\"false\">\n<p><span></p>\n<div>\n<p><img alt=\"Illustration for article titled Remembering Rahmbamarama, the Obama Eras Most Zealous Fan Community\" data-alt=\"Illustration for article titled Remembering Rahmbamarama, the Obama Eras Most Zealous Fan Community\" data-anim-src=\"http://theslot.jezebel.com/\" data-chomp-id=\"jhkfwkujtkt9vhbnq7gm\" data-expanded- data-format=\"jpg\" data- draggable=\"auto\"  src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"></img></p>\n</div>\n<p></span></p><figcaption>Screenshot: Livejournal/thru Rahmbamarama</figcaption></div>\n<p><span data-format=\"jpg\" data-height=\"1396\" data-id=\"jhkfwkujtkt9vhbnq7gm\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jhkfwkujtkt9vhbnq7gm\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-width=\"1690\"></span></figure>\n<figure contenteditable=\"false\" data-format=\"png\" data-height=\"840\" data-id=\"ezjkpkge1f7jd6dw2lee\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ezjkpkge1f7jd6dw2lee\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-width=\"1378\" draggable=\"false\">\n<div contenteditable=\"false\" data-hidecredit=\"false\" data-imagerights=\"other-license\" data-syndicationrights=\"false\">\n<p><span></p>\n<div>\n<p><img alt=\"Illustration for article titled Remembering Rahmbamarama, the Obama Eras Most Zealous Fan Community\" data-alt=\"Illustration for article titled Remembering Rahmbamarama, the Obama Eras Most Zealous Fan Community\" data-anim-src=\"http://theslot.jezebel.com/\" data-chomp-id=\"ezjkpkge1f7jd6dw2lee\" data-expanded- data-format=\"png\" data- draggable=\"auto\"  src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"></img></p>\n</div>\n<p></span></p><figcaption>Screenshot: Livejournal/thru Rahmbamarama</figcaption></div>\n<p><span data-format=\"png\" data-height=\"840\" data-id=\"ezjkpkge1f7jd6dw2lee\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ezjkpkge1f7jd6dw2lee\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-width=\"1378\"></span></figure>\n<p>Rahmbamarama is the closing encapsulation of liberalism within the late 2000s and early 2010s, an period when  Obama used to be the epitome of cool, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert comprise been political<strong> </strong>heroes, Keith Olbermann used to be your favorite curmudgeonly uncle, Rachel Maddow used to be your cool lesbian aunt, and the <span>liberal story world</span> of <em>Parks and Recreation</em> used to be aspirational. It’s an period that already feels far away, not only appropriate due to plenty of of the posts and comments comprise been written in LOLcat structure, however thanks to its deep earnestness—from religion in Democratic politicians to squealing over Emanuel’s butt in a pair of modestly becoming jeans. The nation had continued eight long years of neocon dominance, and the historical election of the first Shaded president used to be as triumphant as it used to be euphoric. Even with the industrial recession inspiring the nation, the potentialities that  gave the influence viable with a charismatic Democrat delight in Obama leading the nation comprise been intoxicating enough to inspire some industrious younger females to assume, “Hiya, yeah, I’ll write fanfic about Democratic Nationwide Committee Chair Howard Dean getting railed by Rahm Emanuel.”</p>\n<p>This phantasm isn’t routine to Democrats; the cult of personality surrounding ragged President Trump proves that. But as Joe Biden—a neatly-liked within the Rahmbamarama universe—begins his own White Dwelling tenure, one has to shock if the liberal fervor of the Rahmbamarama days will return. Right as within the publish-Bush period, the publish-Trump period is ripe to revive the insistent optimism that marked the Obama years.</p>\n<hr>\n</hr>\n<p>In any stan neighborhood, the more exaggerated the fawning, the simpler. That’s the social fore<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a> money of standom, and the commentary at Rahmbamarama used to be no exception.<br /></br></p>\n<p>Emanuel used to be regarded as a intercourse symbol, a hardass DC strategist with a potty mouth whose small physique perceived to trudge on partisan rage. The neighborhood individuals reveled in his advanced-man act (to not yelp the true fact that he had half of a finger lacking, a rapid-meals accident from a long time prior). But as well they made clear to squeal over the true fact that Emanuel used to be a talented ballet dancer who became down a scholarship to the celebrated Joffrey Ballet to support Sarah Lawrence Faculty. This offered the neighborhood a chronicle of two Rahms: A harm up <em>West Skim</em> personality come to lifestyles, and a family man who used to be once nicknamed “tiny dancer” by his sneering critics.</p>\n<p>Luminous the bits and bobs of Emanuel’s biography used to be delight in a badge of honor, and so used to be sharing soiled jokes about him. In one December 2008 blog relating to a<em> Washingtonian</em> article about Emanuel’s cursing, one commenter spoke back “Oh, the issues I want him to entire to me with that soiled, soiled mouth.” A June 2009 <em>Washington Put up</em> <span>article</span> infamous that “Emanuel serves up on-the-file quotes, background crawl and the kind of capital gossip that lubricates relationships.” The response from the Rahmbamarama neighborhood used to be predictable: “As a journalist, I&#8217;m hoping to lubricate my relationship with him too within the future,” one member wrote, “I’d rather lubricate my relationship with Rahm with some KY Intrigue, however a runt pillow talk is at all times welcome.” The comments comprise been even hornier after a <em>Bloomberg</em> article about Emanuel’s divulge routine and “skill to persuade at low quantity and barely over a glass of red wine” used to be shared among the neighborhood that comparable 365 days.</p>\n<p> “Hasn’t one thing delight in this been implied earlier than — that he can come off all candy and at ease and then shock you along with his ferocity the next second?” one commenter spoke back.</p>\n<p>She continued: “Oh God I bet he will get all as much as your face at what he can also merely or can also merely not be aware is an wicked distance for a public surroundings and then strikes encourage earlier than your <em>[sic] </em>can answer and lifts the sting of his shirt to give you and uncover about at his *~abs~however once you reach to feel he slaps your hand away and yells NO TOUCHY and the entire diversified folks within the restaurant hear and he giggles.”</p>\n<p>“LIKE YOUR BRAIN,” any individual spoke back. “CAN I LIVE THERE PLZ.”</p>\n<p>Clearly, Emanuel wasn’t the most attention-grabbing one who bought the soiled medication. The neighborhood used to be also horny for ragged  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner (gradually often known as “Timmeh” on the neighborhood). They comprise been particularly intrigued by one photo thru which he&#8217;s ostensibly eyeing Secretary of Snort Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p>“Um&#8230; What exactly is Timmeh Having a uncover about at in This Portray?” be taught the subject line, followed by, “Does any individual comprise a runt crush on Madam Secretary?”</p>\n<p>“Geithner has such gentle uncover about to him. XD *fangirls*” be taught one answer.</p>\n<p>In Could well perhaps 2010, the neighborhood talked a few few excerpts from a chapter about Emanuel in Jonathan Alter’s <em>The Promise</em>. One preference quote infamous that in most cases, when Emanuel became too labored up, “Obama needed to hose [Rahm] down with a firm ‘Here is gonna win performed, Rahm. This may perhaps occasionally.’”</p>\n<p>“I bet Obama likes to hose him down when he’s on all fours,” one member spoke back. </p>\n<p>“It’s what brought them collectively at the bathouse <em>[sic] </em>all these years ago&#8230;” spoke back yet every other, relating to a factual-flit conspiracy realizing about Obama and Emanuel <span>frequenting homosexual bathhouses</span> in Chicago.</p>\n<p>“Where is the entire Obama admin gangbang fic?” the distinctive commenter spoke back.</p>\n<p>A third member spoke back, “THIIIIIIIIISSSSSSSSS.”</p>\n<p>This used to be fandom habits in a political equipment: out-of-context pictures rendered “shippy,” delight in One Direction fangirls who overanalyzed every gaze between Harry Types and Louis Tomlinson. These females comprise been a runt older than One Direction followers—likely starting from late kids to thirties—however the impulses comprise been identical, as used to be the defensiveness. (When a set of articles <span>serious</span> of Emanuel’s <span>performance</span> made the <span>rounds</span> in spring 2010, responses from Rahmbamarama ranged from “Every person fair appropriate wants to STFU and let Barry be Barry and Rahm be Rahm and shit will win performed” to “STFU Huffington Put up &#8211; You’re on my list.”)</p>\n<p>In one in all the few introspective posts on Rahmbamarama, a neighborhood member asked what all individuals in point of fact realizing of Emanuel’s politics. Given the fangirlish enthusiasm within the entire diversified posts, the responses comprise been surprisingly sober. Many admitted that whereas they admired his personality, his politics weren&#8217;t revolutionary enough, and that his dedication to win shit performed too gradually outweighed a drive to pursue daring solutions and transformative exchange, one thing Obama ostensibly ran on within the future of his marketing campa<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a>. Emanuel used to be antagonistic to the passage of sturdy health care reform delight in the Cheap Care Act (Obamacare), desirous about its lack of bipartisan enchantment and skeptical of its passage. In January 2010, <em>The Wall Aspect road Journal</em> reported that within the future of a 2009 approach assembly with “liberal teams and White Dwelling aides,” Emanuel chided a idea to air adverts targeting conservative Democrats who antagonistic Obama’s healthcare overhaul, calling it “fucking retarded.” He ultimately <span>apologized</span>, for both the commentary and years later for his opposition to what used to be with out concerns Obama’s most attention-grabbing legislative victory. “Thank God for the country, [Obama] didn’t hear to me,” Rahm <span>said</span> after the Supreme Court docket upheld Obamacare in 2012.</p>\n<p>Sadly, his wretched instincts weren’t enough to position his political profession on ice.</p>\n<p>Emanuel’s eventual departure from the White Dwelling in October 2010 used to be met with disappointment and rampant denial, however the announcement of his mayoral marketing campa<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a> in Chicago used to be poised to be equally exuberant. Individuals posted about debates and even talked about assembly up for rallies. But by then, the engagement on Rahmbamarama began to leisurely; Livejournal used to be  falling out of desire, and the Obama period wasn’t fairly as vivid and unusual as it once used to be. After 2011, posts became more and more sporadic. In 2013, any individual posted a Gawker hyperlink about an interview with Brian Williams and the Emanuel brothers: Rahm, who used to be then mayor of Chicago,  Hollywood agent Ari, and Ezekiel, an oncologist and <span>controversial bioethicist</span> who is for the time being a member of Biden’s covid-19 advisory board. The brothers comprise been promoting Ezekiel’s memoir, however Ari used to be it sounds as if heart-broken with the tone of the interview and sent an angry letter to NBC about it.<br /></br></p>\n<p>“My worship for Rahm has been refined by the shit he’s pulled in Chicago over the last few years,” the poster wrote. “But my worship for RBR remains solid. Per chance we’ll all regroup in time for a Gillibrand presidency.”</p>\n<p>The publish bought one lone answer, a paltry showing when put next to the amount of comments this subject would comprise brought in years earlier.</p>\n<p>Among the final posts within the neighborhood used to be in 2014, when a one-time lurker used to be shopping for fanfic: “It used to be a publish with a few drabbles about Rahm and the one I loved the most used to be about his spending time with a French governess (I assume?)“</p>\n<p>She took some time to reminisce relating to the neighborhood at its height, the des<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a> in which it offered her with hours of entertainment after a grueling work shift, and that she’d yet to procure a neighborhood with as many passionate individuals as this one, even on Tumblr. “I in point of fact prefer that we can also rewind time and re-dwell the active days of this neighborhood,” she wrote. “I in point of fact prefer it may perhaps perhaps perhaps well also perk up and begin over, too. But even though it didn’t, every thing I undergo in solutions is smooth right here.”</p>\n<p>And there it remains, 12 years after its advent, a graveyard of damaged Tinypic links and Photobucket pictures lined in grotesque watermarks. It&#8217;s far a relic of a dormant period once it&#8217;s seemingly you&#8217;ll perhaps well perhaps also call your self a revolutionary and fawn over conclude-up pictures of Emanuel’s ass within the future of a consult with with the Israeli Protection Forces at the comparable time with out a trudge of irony.</p>\n<figure contenteditable=\"false\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-height=\"938\" data-id=\"fwb1itnto4rmedliysuv\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommend-id=\"image://fwb1itnto4rmedliysuv\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-width=\"2038\" draggable=\"false\">\n<div contenteditable=\"false\" data-hidecredit=\"false\" data-imagerights=\"other-license\" data-syndicationrights=\"false\">\n<p><span></p>\n<div>\n<p><img alt=\"Illustration for article titled Remembering Rahmbamarama, the Obama Eras Most Zealous Fan Community\" data-alt=\"Illustration for article titled Remembering Rahmbamarama, the Obama Eras Most Zealous Fan Community\" data-anim-src=\"http://theslot.jezebel.com/\" data-chomp-id=\"fwb1itnto4rmedliysuv\" data-expanded- data-format=\"jpg\" data- draggable=\"auto\"  src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"></img></p>\n</div>\n<p></span></p><figcaption>Screenshot: Livejournal/Rahmbamarama</figcaption></div>\n<p><span data-format=\"jpg\" data-height=\"938\" data-id=\"fwb1itnto4rmedliysuv\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommend-id=\"image://fwb1itnto4rmedliysuv\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-width=\"2038\"></span></figure>\n<figure contenteditable=\"false\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-height=\"404\" data-id=\"hzqecee3afinnhszhr2w\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommend-id=\"image://hzqecee3afinnhszhr2w\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-width=\"1972\" draggable=\"false\">\n<div contenteditable=\"false\" data-hidecredit=\"false\" data-imagerights=\"other-license\" data-syndicationrights=\"false\">\n<p><span></p>\n<div>\n<p><img alt=\"Illustration for article titled Remembering Rahmbamarama, the Obama Eras Most Zealous Fan Community\" data-alt=\"Illustration for article titled Remembering Rahmbamarama, the Obama Eras Most Zealous Fan Community\" data-anim-src=\"http://theslot.jezebel.com/\" data-chomp-id=\"hzqecee3afinnhszhr2w\" data-expanded- data-format=\"jpg\" data- draggable=\"auto\"  src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"></img></p>\n</div>\n<p></span></p><figcaption>Screenshot: Livejournal/Rahmbamarama</figcaption></div>\n<p><span data-format=\"jpg\" data-height=\"404\" data-id=\"hzqecee3afinnhszhr2w\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommend-id=\"image://hzqecee3afinnhszhr2w\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-width=\"1972\"></span></figure>\n<figure contenteditable=\"false\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-height=\"396\" data-id=\"bxctyb7ofscl2inqn41y\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommend-id=\"image://bxctyb7ofscl2inqn41y\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-width=\"1964\" draggable=\"false\">\n<div contenteditable=\"false\" data-hidecredit=\"false\" data-imagerights=\"other-license\" data-syndicationrights=\"false\">\n<p><span></p>\n<div>\n<p><img alt=\"Illustration for article titled Remembering Rahmbamarama, the Obama Eras Most Zealous Fan Community\" data-alt=\"Illustration for article titled Remembering Rahmbamarama, the Obama Eras Most Zealous Fan Community\" data-anim-src=\"http://theslot.jezebel.com/\" data-chomp-id=\"bxctyb7ofscl2inqn41y\" data-expanded- data-format=\"jpg\" data- draggable=\"auto\"  src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"></img></p>\n</div>\n<p></span></p><figcaption>Screenshot: Livejournal/Rahmbamarama</figcaption></div>\n<p><span data-format=\"jpg\" data-height=\"396\" data-id=\"bxctyb7ofscl2inqn41y\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommend-id=\"image://bxctyb7ofscl2inqn41y\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-width=\"1964\"></span></figure>\n<hr>\n</hr>\n<p>I was a member of Rahmbamarama, a truth I fully forgot until I saw my Livejournal username pop up within the commentary a part of a few random Anderson Cooper-related blogs. I was 18 years aged and, it sounds as if, manner more into Cooper than Emanuel. But I’m not the most attention-grabbing outmoded of the neighborhood who now works in media. Aja Romano,  a workers writer at Vox, created Rahmbamarama with a few others. She used to be what we called a BNF (mountainous title fan) who carried a serious amount of clout on Livejournal. In diversified words, she used to be fandom infamous, and her involvement with Rahmbamarama no doubt legitimized the neighborhood. After I reached out to Romano for commentary, she used to be within the foundation furious to consult with me about this period of web history, however after reaching out to her ragged co-mods who declined to discuss on the file, she determined to bow out too.</p>\n<p>I’m not shocked: There’s most attention-grabbing one thing more embarrassing than having once been a member of a Rahm Emanuel fan neighborhood, and that’s rising the neighborhood within the first field.</p>\n<p>Its existence is especially embarrassing given Emanuel’s tune file as Mayor of Chicago from 2011 to 2019. His handful of <span>successes</span> faded in comparability to the <span>mountain of failures</span> that plagued Chicago below his leer, from the city’s education crisis to its policing equipment. Most galling used to be his handling of the 2014 death of Laquan McDonald, a 17-365 days-aged Shaded boy shot 16 times by a white Chicago police officer. For over a 365 days, Emanuel <span>fought</span> against releasing the police dashcam footage detailing the occasion, arguing that the incident used to be smooth below investigation. But in November 2015—with ease following his re-election—a Cook dinner County deem ordered its liberate. Jason Van Dyke, the police officer to blame for McDonald’s death, used to be charged with assassinate that comparable day. <span>According</span> to the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>,  “the prolong within the assassinate label, mixed with the true fact that Emanuel’s administration and aldermen paid a $5 million settlement to the McDonald family earlier than a lawsuit used to be even filed, resulted in accusations of a City Hall duvet-up.” </p>\n<p>Emanuel now presents political commentary on ABC, however he remains a runt little bit of a political pariah. </p>\n<p>“Oh my God, my blood ran chilly fair appropriate studying the comm title,” said one ragged Rahmbamarama member who goes by LadyPolitik on social media. I sent her a message on Twitter telling her I was writing relating to the neighborhood. “When his title resurfaces now I originate <span>Lisa Simpson Vexed Face</span>.”</p>\n<p>She added, “a range of us comprise been worthy furious to be into the first publish-Dubya admin—or first time balloting, EVER—and it bought wild.”</p>\n<p>And it used to be ripe for parasocial interplay, thru which the consumption of a mass media settle develops into an imagined intimacy. With this intimacy comes loyalty and devotion. This isn’t unusual, however social media has made this even stronger: Highly efficient figures are more accessible than ever, and proper-world relationships and communities are created essentially essentially based on collective infatuation.</p>\n<p>Rahmbamarama used to be built on the premise of relating to the Obama administration and all of its gamers as a barrel of fun, a barrel of “lolz” even: The president used to be hot and so used to be his valuable other, the vice president wore cool aviators, the manager of workers said “fuck” loads. After eight years of<strong> </strong>aged fogies and battle hawks running the country, Obama used to be alleged to be an unmistakable breath of unusual air in phrases of both policy and tone. The Obama administration played into this perception of effortless cool as successfully, making clear their legit <span>Flickr</span> account had diverse <span>pictures</span> of Obama <span>playing along with his canine</span>, <span>hugging babies</span>, getting his <span>bromance</span> on with Biden, and placing out with <span>Beyoncé</span>. For the most dedicated Obamanistas, no one—conspiracy-addled Republicans, Blue Dogs in Congress, skeptics extra to the left—would be their killjoys.</p>\n<p>But neither Beyoncé’s seal of approval nor Leslie Knope’s <span>crush</span> on  <span>Biden</span> used to be enough to halt the tide of the Trumpism that followed the Obama years. Crossposting fanfiction about Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert fucking to Rahmbamarama no doubt isn’t to blame for this shift, however there’s one thing to be said about denialism that so with out concerns comes with emotional connections to political figures. There aren’t enough <span>Hillary Clinton cameos</span> on <em>Substantial City</em> within the enviornment to exchange the true fact that she used to be detested by worthy swaths of the country for a long time, fair appropriate because the entire memes within the enviornment couldn’t <a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a>ore the true fact that Emanuel used to be an gradually poisonous influence within the White Dwelling and within the future of his tenure as mayor of Chicago. The Biden period is inclined to this more or less uncommon political fandom that swaps feelings for politics, especially as folks are already more enamored with <span>rising fanfiction</span> about Vice President Kamala Harris’s <span>stepdaughter</span> than measuring the categorical deliver of issues.</p>\n<p>No person is freed from embarrassing phases, and the bonds that can originate from a fannish infatuation are proper irrespective of their origins. Cherish the girl who wrote one in all the Rahmbamarama’s final posts, in most cases you fair appropriate want a fun, senseless distraction after a grueling day of work, and talking about Emanuel’s stroke sport with a bunch of diversified females did the trick. If there’s one lesson to be discovered from Rahmbamarama, it’s that even your faves will ultimately disappoint you, and being insanely horny for them won’t originate the disappointment harm any less.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n","title":"Remembering Rahmbamarama, the Obama Era’s Most Zealous Fan Community","date":"January 26, 2021","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"remembering-rahmbamarama,-the-obama-era&#8217;s-most-zealous-fan-community","localFile":{"childImageSharp":null}}}},"previous":{"uri":"/2021/01/26/assassins-creed-valhalla-players-find-ancient-alien-bow-in-rock-pile/","title":"Assassin’s Creed Valhalla players find ancient alien bow in rock pile"},"next":{"uri":"/2021/01/26/have-you-played-dishonored-2/","title":"Have You Played… Dishonored 2?"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyMzMzOQ==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyMzUzOA==","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoyMzU4OA=="}},"staticQueryHashes":["104267996","1682016598","848497233"]}
