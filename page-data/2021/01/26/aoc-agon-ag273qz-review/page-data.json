That is pretty even as you are procuring a show mask mask that&#8217;s 24in or 25in in size, however when many 240Hz monitors stretch that choice your whole manner to 27in, a large selection of them change into sick-estimable to heavy desktop work due to the their low pixel densities. Luckily, the tide&#8217;s starting to flip in this admire, as we&#8217;re now seeing an increasing amount of 27in, 240Hz monitors with upright 2560&#215;1440 resolutions &#8211; a noteworthy extra gracious resolve for those after a show mask mask that can pull double obligations as a piece and play video show. The AOC Agon AG273QZ is one such gaming boom, offering a somewhat more cost effective (and flatter) different to Samsung&#8217;s equally-specced Odyssey G7. </p>\n<p>Naturally, 240Hz monitors with a 1440p choice aloof boom rather a top price over decrease refresh price 1440p screens, however at £469 (US pricing TBC), the AOC Agon AG273QZ is aloof rather rather more straightforward on the wallet than Samsung&#8217;s £540 / $700 Odyssey G7. A expedient section of that is probably going the total plot down to the AOC&#8217;s amount of panel, which uses a flat TN show mask mask as a change of Samsung&#8217;s twisted, VA-based totally Quantum Dot skills. The Odyssey G7 also has a somewhat increased HDR score than its AOC rival, meeting VESA&#8217;s DisplayHDR 600 specification as a change of the entry-stage DisplayHDR 400 usual. </p>\n<p>I have not tested Samsung&#8217;s Odyssey G7 but to investigate cross-test the plot in which it compares, however there are several things about the AOC that slay a colossal first affect ind<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a>ant by its decrease value. As an example, its TN panel has handsome color accuracy, covering a shut to-ultimate <strong>99.3% of the sRGB color gamut</strong> straight out of the field on its default settings (that&#8217;s its Same old Eco mode preset, Heat color temperature environment and its Gamma 1 probability, even as you are questioning). That is somewhat darn uncommon for a TN panel, and is true as gorgeous as, if now not better than, what you&#8217;d request to investigate cross-test on extra costly IPS and VA displays. </p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"A photo showing the rear of the AOC Agon AG273QZ gaming monitor\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2021/01/AOC-Agon-AG273QZ-monitor-back-1212x682.jpg\" width=\"1212\"></img></p>\n<p>The AG273QZ&#8217;s DCI-P3 protection was somewhat gorgeous, too, covering 85.4% out of the field. The DCI-P3 gamut is what&#8217;s frequent to measure a video show&#8217;s HDR chops, and while 85.4% is now not the most practical resolve I&#8217;ve seen (certainly, VESA&#8217;s DisplayHDR 400 specification doesn&#8217;t in actuality require a video show to grasp a particular gamut protection in this admire), it is aloof somewhat decent all things knowing to be. Even the very most productive HDR displays only ought to hit a minimum of 90% of the DCI-P3 gamut to meet VESA&#8217;s extra improved DisplayHDR requirements, so 85% is aloof somewhat gorgeous going. </p>\n<p>It is miles in most cases very bright, hitting a peak white stage of around <strong>460cd/m2</strong>. That is greater than sufficient for day to day expend. Indeed, in low lighting stipulations, I learned that environment its brightness to real 10 (out of 100) was plenty &#8211; one thing else extra would stress my eyes. I elevate out wish it went rather dimmer, all informed, however a minimum of there is a low blue light mode constructed into the video show&#8217;s onboard menu system to back live your eyes from getting too overwhelmed at increased brightness ranges.</p>\n<p>That mentioned, even a peak brightness stage of 460cd/m2 is now not in actuality sufficient to slay noteworthy of an impact when it involves switching on the show mask mask&#8217;s HDR improve. Admittedly, right here&#8217;s recurrently the case with VESA DisplayHDR 400 monitors, as there are a large selection of non-HDR monitors that will presumably additionally additionally hit the same brightness ranges. Indeed, after I booted up Assassin&#8217;s Creed Odyssey, my scamper-to HDR recreation, I could presumably barely boom the adaptation between its HDR and non-HDR settings. The game looked equally bright to my eyes, so that is now not a video show I could presumably indicate for a stonking HDR skills. To love the tubby whack of what HDR can offer, you in actuality want a video show that&#8217;s even brighter, and I could presumably seemingly protect in mind VESA&#8217;s DisplayHDR 600 usual to be completely the minimum you needs to be aiming for right here. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_932529\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"A photo showing the display outputs of the AOC Agon AG273QZ gaming monitor.\" height=\"681\" src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2021/01/AOC-Agon-AG273QZ-monitor-display-ports-1212x681.jpg\" width=\"1212\"></img><figcaption>The AOC Agon AG273QZ has two HDMI 2.0 inputs and two DisplayPort 1.4 inputs.</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_932531\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"A photo showing the USB hub of the AOC Agon AG273QZ gaming monitor.\" height=\"681\" src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2021/01/AOC-Agon-AG273QZ-monitor-USB-ports-1212x681.jpg\" width=\"1212\"></img><figcaption>There are four USB 3.2 ports on the AOC Agon AG273QZ, alongside with separate microphone and headphone jacks.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Alas, despite the AG273QZ&#8217;s handsome color accuracy, there had been diversified aspects of the boom that left noteworthy to be desired. It had rather a high dim stage, for starters, coming in at <strong>0.65cd/m2</strong>, per my X-Rite DisplayPro i1 color calibrator, even supposing I did arrange to fetch this the total plot down to a extra gracious 0.50cd/m2 with rather of fiddling. It wasn&#8217;t so execrable that blacks now not sleep taking a see noticeably grey, per se, however there was a noticeable crimson tinge to them on its default settings. Mixed with its heart-broken contrast ratio of real <strong>704:1</strong>, and this recurrently made shadow areas very hazy and indistinct, making it troublesome to discern a large selection of detail in darker recreation scenes.  </p>\n<p>I was ready to slay the show mask mask investigate cross-test darker and now no more crimson by switching over to its sRGB color temperature environment and downgrading its Shadow Regulate probability kind 50 to 40, however this in actuality resulted in an even worse contrast ratio &#8211; real 491:1. Fortunately, its color accuracy, brightness and its dim stage stayed about the identical on these contemporary settings, however are attempting as I could presumably, I could now not receive any manner to supply a have interaction to the video show&#8217;s contrast. </p>\n<p>Making these adjustments also didn&#8217;t fetch to the bottom of my diversified main discipline with the AG273QZ, and that&#8217;s its heart-broken coping with of textual affirm and note documents. Whereas my desktop looked pleasingly interesting thanks to the bump in choice, the video show&#8217;s low contrast ratio aloof made textual affirm troublesome to read in opposition to a pure white background. It was nearly cherish I was reading off a 1920&#215;1080 boom every other time, which somewhat defeats the purpose of getting a show mask mask that can elevate out 2560&#215;1440. </p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"A photo of the AOC Agon AG273QZ gaming monitor.\" height=\"681\" src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2021/01/AOC-Agon-AG273QZ-monitor-1212x681.jpg\" width=\"1212\"></img></p>\n<p>As on those 1080p screens, this readability discipline was less glaring when taking part in games. HUD and menu textual affirm stood out perfectly properly when provided in opposition to a bright background, and was easy to read at a usual viewing distance. And that is pretty even as you are procuring a 240Hz show mask mask that&#8217;s going to be frequent purely for taking part in games. However as I mentioned at the open of this overview, the main attraction of these 1440p, 240Hz displays is that they needs to be a better match for work and play alike. Alas, I cannot grunt that&#8217;s in particular upright of the Agon AG273QZ, which puts rather a mountainous dampener on it. </p>\n<p>The AG273QZ is a wonderfully gorgeous gaming show mask mask, combining a high refresh price with colossal color accuracy, however its heart-broken contrast ratio manner you real slay now not fetch the tubby honest appropriate thing about its increased choice. In actual fact, you would be  getting a more cost effective 1080p, 240Hz gaming boom cherish AOC&#8217;s C27G2ZU (within the meanwhile my high 240Hz video show suggestion) as a change of this, or certainly proceed for  AOC&#8217;s sufficient (and extremely equally-named) Agon AG273QX even as you are obvious to follow a 1440p choice. The AG273QX only has a 165Hz refresh price, all informed, however that&#8217;s aloof greater than sufficient headroom for prime refresh price gaming in my eyes, and its real as real VA panel also has infinitely better contrast, viewing angles and dim ranges.</p>\n</p></div>\n</p></div>\n","title":"AOC Agon AG273QZ review","date":"January 26, 2021","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"aoc-agon-ag273qz-review","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='400'%20height='225'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20225'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'%3e%3cpath%20d='M184%2016l-1%203v3H80v45c1%2072%202%2097%203%2098h88l3%202c3%203%207%205%2010%205%202%200%203%200%203%203-1%203-1%204-6%204-25%203-70%2018-71%2023%200%202%200%202%204%202l6-1c2-2%2055-15%2063-15%207%200%2010%205%2013%2018l1%207-1-7c0-7-2-17-4-21-1-3%209-3%2015%201%205%202%209%202%205%200-3-2-1-3%202-3s3%200%203%202l-1%208v1c3-8%2012-8%2026%200%2018%2011%2023%2012%2028%207%202-2%202-2%207-1l7%203h10l-1-5-2-3c0-2%204%202%205%204%200%202%203%203%203%201l-3-5c-4-6-8-5-7%201l-7-2c-4-2-6-3-5-4%201-3-1-4-3-3-3%202-3%202-11-2-5-2-9-3-10-2-2%200-2%200-1-1h-1c-3%200-3%200-2-1h-1l-4-1-7-2-4-1%203-3%206-5%202-4h38l38-1c1-1%203-139%202-141l-49-1h-49v-2c0-6-2-3-4%208l-3%2012v67c0%2077%201%2070-10%2064l-6-3%206-1h6v-29l-9%201c-8%200-9%200-9-2l6-1h9l3-1-1-47%201-48c1-1%203-5%203-8l3-9-15-1h-15l1%203a602%20602%200%2000-4-8c0-2-1-3-2-1m23%2027a1286%201286%200%20004%2085%201089%201089%200%2000-2-86l-2%201m-26%207c-14%206-26%2024-26%2041%200%2019%2012%2038%2029%2045%204%201%202-3-3-5l-10-8a44%2044%200%20018-69l6-5v-1l-4%202m39%200l5%204c29%2016%2029%2059%200%2076-3%202-6%205-3%205%202%200%2014-10%2017-14%2017-22%2013-52-11-68-6-4-8-5-8-3m44%20104c1%201%200%201-3%201-4%200-4%200-4%203v3h22v-3c0-3-1-3-5-3l-5-1-1-2-1%202v1l-1-1-1-2-1%202m-43%2016c0%205%200%205%203%205h6l10-9-9-1h-10v5m176%208c0%202-6%207-7%206l-3%201-3%202-1%201c0%202%200%202-2%201h-3l-2%201-1%201-3%202h-3c0-2-1-1-3%200%200%201-2%202-3%201l-2%201h-2l-4%201-5%202a5411%205411%200%200131%202h19v-9l-1-10v-1h1l-1-2h-2m-170%202c0%204%2019%2010%2021%208%203-4%201-5-12-8h-9'%20fill='%23d3d3d3'%20fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e","aspectRatio":1.7730496453900708,"src":"/static/0114b85ca9bd78ecdba78421d6cdd99d/724c8/24559-aoc-agon-ag273qz-review.jpg","srcSet":"/static/0114b85ca9bd78ecdba78421d6cdd99d/84d81/24559-aoc-agon-ag273qz-review.jpg 250w,\n/static/0114b85ca9bd78ecdba78421d6cdd99d/f0719/24559-aoc-agon-ag273qz-review.jpg 500w,\n/static/0114b85ca9bd78ecdba78421d6cdd99d/724c8/24559-aoc-agon-ag273qz-review.jpg 1000w,\n/static/0114b85ca9bd78ecdba78421d6cdd99d/273de/24559-aoc-agon-ag273qz-review.jpg 1212w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}}}}},"previous":{"uri":"/2021/01/26/hitman-3-is-out-now/","title":"Hitman 3 is out now"},"next":{"uri":"/2021/01/26/darkmoon-races-is-hearthstones-first-mini-expansion/","title":"Darkmoon Races is Hearthstone’s first mini-expansion"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyNDU1OQ==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyNDU1Ng==","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoyNDU2Mg=="}},"staticQueryHashes":["104267996","1682016598","848497233"]}
