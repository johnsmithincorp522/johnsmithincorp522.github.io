BioWare spent years dodging any genuine affirmation that the fourth recreation was in the works, but now BioWare possess acknowledged in no unsure phrases that they&#8217;re working on the following Dragon Age recreation, though we aloof know treasured limited about it from two teaser trailers, a gradual-the-scenes video, and a few knowing art. </p>\n<p>We aloof have not actually gotten a correct scrutinize at Dragon Age 4&#8217;s gameplay, or heck even a title, but BioWare possess begun to sprinkle out teasers more again and again starting in summer season 2020.
