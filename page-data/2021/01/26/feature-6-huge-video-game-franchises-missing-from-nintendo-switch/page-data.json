Wii U might perchance well need bombed commercially (although it had a blinding spectacular library of games), but its hybrid successor has effect Nintendo wait on on top, attracting basically the most proficient developers and basically the most racy names within the industry to effect games on the console.</p>\n<p>Then over again, there stay some illustrious franchises and luminary studios that haven&#8217;t attain to Switch but. No, we&#8217;re no longer speaking about ports from PC developers or mobile gaming giants bringing no longer going ports of their world-conquering MOBAs and clickers; quite, devs and publishers with a storied console history — which contains Nintendo systems — that haven&#8217;t confirmed as much as the Switch celebration for some reason.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a chunk routine for of us that judge how Nintendo attracted all forms of third-parties throughout the Wii and DS generation, even when it supposed setting up bespoke, decrease-speced variations of tentpole games. Switch is conserving shuffle with Wii sales at the the same point in its lifetime, but there are restful some huge wait on-outs. We&#8217;re speaking titans of the gaming world — a few of basically the most a hit franchises within the history of the medium.</p>\n<p>Presumably publishers purchased stung by Wii U and passed over the boat this time. Presumably they merely don&#8217;t judge the earnings of investing in Switch while they&#8217;re raking in billions in other locations. Presumably they save no longer imagine Switch gamers rob the forms of games they maintain&#8230;</p>\n<p>Regardless of the causes, we possess picked out a half-dozen world infamous franchises which might perchance well well be no longer to be stumbled on on Nintendo&#8217;s most contemporary console. You might perchance well well possibly also squawk us within the poll at the very backside which ones you might perchance well most take dangle of to leer on Switch.</p>\n<h2>Metallic Gear Solid</h2>\n<figure>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Metal Gear Solid\" data-original=\"https://images.nintendolife.com/490eb7106cf58/metal-gear-solid.900x.jpg\" height=\"506\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 900 506'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"900\"></img><span title=\"Image Credit\">© Konami</span></p>\n</figure>\n<p>We would forgive you for thinking of Metallic Gear basically as a &#8216;Sony&#8217; series thanks to the affect of the long-lasting <strong>Metallic Gear Solid</strong> when it launched on PlayStation in 1998. Then over again, the Konami-owned, Hideo Kojima-helmed stealth series has featured on more than one Nintendo platforms over time, including the Game Boy Coloration, the 3DS and Wii (whenever you count Virtual Console releases with that closing one). Metallic Gear Solid itself develop into as soon as ported to GameCube within the blueprint of <strong>The Twin Snakes</strong> and the very first sport within the Metallic Gear series got right here to the NES following its MSX2 debut. The mainline series can also possess ass<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a> up camp in other locations, but Nintendo gamers possess had some stunning times with Snake, even within the occasion that they&#8217;ve passed over some of the colossal &#8216;uns.</p>\n<p>So how attain Snake&#8217;s no longer on Switch but? Neatly, let&#8217;s no longer omit that he <em>is</em> a playable personality in <strong>Super Rupture Bros. Final</strong> — he even has his be pleased amiibo!</p>\n<p>Aloof, the Metallic Gear series is in every other case a consuming no-order their own praises on Switch. While there develop into as soon as a search data from tag over the future course of the series ever since series creator Kojima and and the IP homeowners parted ideas in 2015 (as did many key team participants who left to work with him on <strong>Demise Stranding</strong> at Kojima Productions), Konami has it sounds as if been taking its time deciding how simplest to proceed with the series without its creator and authentic group onboard.</p>\n<p>To our minds, that sounds esteem the fitting time for a Switch port or two of older series entries, but there&#8217;s no guessing with Konami. For each and each solid gold retro liberate they effect out a turkey or a licenced pachinko machine, so or no longer it is subtle to articulate what&#8217;s on the cards.</p>\n<p>We provide out tear away out sneaking around with Snake, though. There are heaps of other stealth games on Switch, but Metallic Gear is restful top canines in the case of tactical espionage action. Attain us a Solid, Konami — you might perchance well even possess saved us waiting long sufficient, no?</p>\n<h2>Name of Responsibility</h2>\n<figure>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"COD Modern Warfare\" data-original=\"https://images.nintendolife.com/6bc57a70ed189/cod-modern-warfare.900x.jpg\" height=\"506\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 900 506'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"900\"></img><span title=\"Image Credit\">© Activision</span></p>\n</figure>\n<p>Activision&#8217;s cinematic first-individual shooter series has regarded on Nintendo consoles in some blueprint since 2004 with <strong>Name of Responsibility: Most racy Hour</strong> on GameCube, which arrived merely a twelve months after the Name of Responsibility franchise first locked and loaded. GameCube also hosted <strong>Wide Red One</strong> sooner than we saw variations of <strong>Name of Responsibility 3</strong>, <strong>In model Battle</strong>, <strong>Sunless Ops</strong> and <strong>In model Battle 3</strong> on Wii. Then there had been the a immense selection of DS ports and poke-offs, too.</p>\n<p>While the Nintendo ports — on the entire running on more modest hardware in comparison with rival platforms — might perchance well by no device be belief to be the &#8216;premier&#8217; variations, the truth that Activision supported those systems said something about their dedication to Nintendo&#8217;s target market and the importance it positioned on the platforms.</p>\n<p>So why possess they gone AWOL on Switch, no topic inserting no longer one but <em>two</em> ports on Wii U within the forms of <strong>Sunless Ops II</strong> and <strong>Ghosts</strong>? Neatly, getting stung by those closing two thanks to the Wii Americalow set up execrable in overall is a component — you obtain the impression that Activision will be using the the same tag of reactionary resolution-making plaguing EA in the present day.</p>\n<p>Presumably the accurate reason lies in how games esteem <strong>Minecraft</strong> and <strong>Fortnite</strong> possess shifted the PlayStation and Xbox demographics youthful than they had been within the Wii and DS days. The ass<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a> Activision can also possess previously considered Nintendo variations as agreeable investments on platforms that historically attracted youthful gamers — to hook them on the franchise sooner than they graduated to 1 in all the meatier, &#8216;grown-up&#8217; consoles — in the present day the target market has shifted and they might be able to rob those younger hearts and minds without leaving Sony and Microsoft&#8217;s ecosystems. <em>All people&#8217;s a winner.</em></p>\n<p>As an alternative of Switch gamers who don&#8217;t be pleased one other console, that is. It&#8217;s taken some time, but Switch has accrued a superb library of first-individual shooters over the closing four years. Realistically, we&#8217;re no longer expecting a Switch port of <strong>Warzone</strong> or a downgraded model of the next instalment, but we would restful admire the chance to enlist with Captain Des<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a>ate over again, though.</p>\n<h2>Tomb Raider</h2>\n<figure>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Shadow Of The Tomb Raider\" data-original=\"https://images.nintendolife.com/faa1f6178c894/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider.900x.jpg\" height=\"506\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 900 506'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"900\"></img><span title=\"Image Credit\">© Sq. Enix</span></p>\n</figure>\n<p>Never mind that Lara Croft debuted on the Sega Saturn — powerful esteem Metallic Gear, the affect of Core Kind&#8217;s <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> on PlayStation wait on in 1996 made it seem that Lara belonged to Sony&#8217;s stable of stars. All over again, in actual fact that Tomb Raider games had been landing on Nintendo systems ever since <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> on the Game Boy Coloration in 2000, and there develop into as soon as even a Nintendo 64 port within the works till Sony s<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a>ed an exclusivity deal and tied Lara to PlayStation till the flip of the millennium.</p>\n<p>We saw several games within the series though the GameCube / GBA and Wii / DS eras, although the Wii U purchased no Tomb Raiders of any model. Crystal Dynamic&#8217;s trilogy of games — <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> (2013), <strong>Upward thrust of the Tomb Raider</strong> (2015) and <strong>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</strong> (2018) — all got right here and went on other platforms, but Crystal Dynamics it sounds as if did now not would like to wait on out a half-hearted job with GamePad integration on Wii U.</p>\n<p>Will we ever judge Lara Croft on Switch? Neatly, that closing trilogy of games develop into as soon as printed by Sq. Enix, and that company will be a chunk <em>all over the ass<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a></em> in most cases. We have had winners esteem <strong>Octopath Traveler</strong> on Switch, plus a spate of <strong>Final Delusion</strong> re-releases, so it’s no longer very no longer going Sq. might perchance well delve into its publishing wait on catalogue over again.</p>\n<p>Given the prefer (if a tag contemporary sport is off the table), we&#8217;ll desire a Crystal Dynamics trilogy package alongside the strains of the <strong>Borderlands Assortment</strong> or the <strong>BioShock Assortment</strong>, please.</p>\n<h2>The Sims</h2>\n<figure>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"The Sims 4\" data-original=\"https://images.nintendolife.com/bc39b7074d97c/the-sims-4.900x.jpg\" height=\"588\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 900 588'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"900\"></img><span title=\"Image Credit\">© EA</span></p>\n</figure>\n<p>The EA-printed existence sim series which spun out of Will Wright&#8217;s <strong>SimCity</strong> games, <strong>The Sims</strong> might perchance well well appear all gentle-hearted and zany on the exterior, but or no longer it is an infinite, <em>huge</em> deal by recognition and earnings. Starting in 2000, they&#8217;re as much as number four appropriate now, but there are a metric ton of poke-offs and alternate ports and variations connected to this IP.</p>\n<p>The Maxis-developed series has regarded (in some blueprint or other) on GameCube, Wii, GBA, DS and 3DS&#8230; but no longer Switch. <strong>The Sims 4</strong> will be stumbled on on PS4 and Xbox One&#8230; but no longer Switch.</p>\n<p>Why, you search data from? Neatly, you judge we mentioned EA up there? That&#8217;s most potentially the reason. Despite being rapidly off the tag with enhance for Wii U (games esteem <strong>Mass Produce 3</strong> and the elegant <strong>Want for Sprint: Most Wished U</strong> spring to mind), evidently EA top brass had been caught off guard with Switch and they are stubbornly refusing to imagine there would be any most s<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a>ificant return on investment. No question they&#8217;ll soar onboard Nintendo&#8217;s next console, which is ready to then tank, and the entire dumb cycle will repeat over again.</p>\n<p>With games esteem <strong>Burnout Paradise Remastered</strong> and <strong>Want for Sprint: Scorching Pursuit Remastered</strong>, we <em>possess</em> viewed some belated efforts to courtroom Switch gamers (<strong>Apex Legends</strong> will be with us soon, too), but or no longer it is tricky to muster powerful enthusiasm for a corporation that throws out scraps (three &#8216;Legacy Editions&#8217; of <strong>FIFA</strong> in a row) and expects you to be grateful.</p>\n<p>Now, if we had been in a position to play a solid port of The Sims 4 on Switch, and perchance title one in all our sims &#8216;Ernie Arts&#8217;, and possibly lock them in a room and not using a bathroom, we <em>might perchance well</em> be ready to forgive and omit. <em>The ball&#8217;s on your courtroom, EA.</em></p>\n<h2>Gigantic Theft Auto</h2>\n<figure>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"GTA V\" data-original=\"https://images.nintendolife.com/fb2f6f30a8247/gta-v.900x.jpg\" height=\"506\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 900 506'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"900\"></img><span title=\"Image Credit\">© Rockstar Video games</span></p>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>Gigantic Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars</strong> on DS develop into as soon as colossal, and the Game Boy Coloration purchased ports of every and each the distinctive 2D <strong>Gigantic Theft Auto</strong> and its also-2D sequel, <strong>Gigantic Theft Auto 2</strong>; the latter, nonetheless, develop into as soon as the closing time that a mainline GTA would attain to a Nintendo console of any model.</p>\n<p>2004&#8217;s <strong>Gigantic Theft Auto Come</strong> is mainly the most racy other entry within the franchise Nintendo followers possess purchased their palms on over time, which is a shame because, like it or detest it, GTA is one in all the medium&#8217;s defining franchises. We want to leer it attain to Switch in some blueprint — if finest an HD assortment of some of the older entries (a twin pack of <strong>Vice City</strong> and <strong>San Andreas</strong>, as an instance, would be a in actual fact warm proposition). While you thought at something as evidently scalable as <strong>GTA V</strong> — a sport which started existence on PS3 and Xbox 360 and has variations for PS5 and Xbox Series X scheduled for liberate by the discontinuance of the twelve months — or no longer it is disappointing that Rockstar hasn&#8217;t frail a little half of its tall resources to assemble a model for Nintendo gamers. There must be dozens of Switches strewn all over desks in Rockstar headquarters! Somebody, someplace in-house must possess toyed with the belief&#8230;</p>\n<p>Sadly, the enormous monetary success of <strong>GTA On-line</strong> might perchance well very well be the reason Rockstar can&#8217;t safe the enthusiasm to lift GTA to Switch, no topic the blueprint. We have restful purchased our fingers crossed that Nintendo nostalgia might perchance well obtain the upper of someone up the food chain at Rockstar, though.</p>\n<h2>Ridge Racer</h2>\n<figure>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Ridge Racer 4\" data-original=\"https://images.nintendolife.com/6406c6a09706c/ridge-racer-4.900x.jpg\" height=\"506\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 900 506'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"900\"></img><span title=\"Image Credit\">© Bandai Namco</span></p>\n</figure>\n<p>While no longer half the money spinner these forms of other franchises are, Namco&#8217;s quintessential arcade racer has a diversified reveal in our hearts and or no longer it is miles the closing series we&#8217;re determined to leer return in some model, and preferably to a Nintendo console. The series might perchance well need skipped Nintendo house systems after <strong>Ridge Racer 64</strong> and poke-off <strong>R: Racing Evolution</strong> on the GameCube, but we also purchased entries on the DS and 3DS.</p>\n<p>Arguably, Ridge Racer is but one other one in all those <em>&#8216;hold on, is no longer that a PlayStation series?&#8217;</em> games, but we don&#8217;t judge any the clarification why Bandai Namco (simplest buds with Nintendo in the present day, be aware) might perchance well well now not lift Reiko Nagase and her immediate of uber-consuming cars to Switch and add a splash of RR&#8217;s trademark drifting and slick presentation to Switch&#8217;s rising garage of racing games. The closing entry to attain wait on to consoles develop into as soon as 2012&#8217;s <strong>Ridge Racer Unbounded</strong>, so the series is due a revival.</p>\n<hr>\n</hr>\n<p><em>There are other
