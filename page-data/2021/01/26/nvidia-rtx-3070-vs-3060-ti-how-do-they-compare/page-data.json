To again you have conclude which graphics card is the supreme one for you, I&#8217;ve effect collectively some at hand benchmark graphs to demonstrate you exactly how they stack up in all of on the present time&#8217;s largest and supreme PC video games at 1080p, 1440p and 4K.</p>\n<p>To test the RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti, I paired them with an Intel Core i5-10600K processor and 16GB of Corsair Vengeance LED RAM, and effect them head to head in my suite of graphics benchmarks, taking a median body fee from both their luxuriate in constructed-in benchmark instruments or from my luxuriate in repeatable handbook gameplay exams. The video games encompass a mixture of blockbusters from the closing couple of years: Shadow Of The Tomb Raider, Total Battle: Three Kingdoms, Closing Delusion XV, Monster Hunter: World, Murderer&#8217;s Creed Valhalla, The Witcher 3, Metro Exodus, and Cyberpunk 2077. </p>\n<p>For this explicit head-to-head, I&#8217;ve feeble the Nvidia Founders Edition of the RTX 3060 Ti and Zotac&#8217;s GeForce RTX 3070 Twin Edge. These bear been the cards I feeble for my respective GPU reports, and I ran each cards at their default clock speeds as they came within the box. As a result, they would perchance perchance furthermore mute be slightly representative of what their respective card classes are able to. I would possibly perchance perchance furthermore mute furthermore gift that these figures are according to their raw performance in each of these video games, with all ray tracing and DLSS alternate suggestions switched off. Here&#8217;s how they bought on.</p>\n<h2>Nvidia RTX 3070 vs 3060 Ti: 1080p benchmarks</h2>\n<p>Starting up with their <strong>1920&#215;1080 performance</strong>, you would possibly perchance perchance perchance furthermore witness straight that each of these cards are larger than able to taking part in video games on max settings at this resolution, hitting as a minimum 70fps (or thereabouts) in 2020&#8217;s most traumatic PC video games, Murderer&#8217;s Creed Valhalla and Cyberpunk 2077, and well in scheme over 100fps in 2018 and 2019&#8217;s mountainous video games. </p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"A bar chart graph comparing the 1080p performance of the RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti\" height=\"620\" src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2021/01/Nvidia-RTX-3070-vs-3060-ti-benchmarks-1080p-ultra.jpg\" width=\"1000\"></img></p>\n<p>In masses of instances, the RTX 3070 affords around a 10-20fps enchancment over the RTX 3060 Ti, even when there are a shimmering few instances the build that gap is considerable narrower. In Closing Delusion XV, to illustrate, each cards managed the same practical of 103fps with all of the further Nvidia settings turned off at this resolution. I would possibly perchance perchance furthermore mute gift, the RTX 3070 regained its 10-uncommon fps lead after I switched on all of these aforementioned effects, averaging 82fps versus the RTX 3060 Ti&#8217;s 73fps, but by ass<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a>ment of the sport&#8217;s default Absolute best settings, they&#8217;re each considerable of a muchness. Murderer&#8217;s Creed Valhalla is terribly conclude, too, with a median of edifying 3fps between each card.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, here&#8217;s likely down to my sequence of processor than a distress with the RTX 3070&#8217;s performance per se. Whereas my Intel Core i5-10600K is slightly highly efficient in comparison with outdated generations of Intel&#8217;s Core i5 chips, 1920&#215;1080 is mute a resolution the build your CPU can bear a extra special amount of distinction to your PC&#8217;s overall performance. Ensuing from the sheer amount of energy accessible in on the present time&#8217;s RTX cards, video games are a ways more susceptible to make certain by the boundaries of your CPU at this resolution than your GPU. As such, you&#8217;d likely witness better results from the RTX 3070 here with a sooner CPU.</p>\n<p>Equally, even when, whenever you are no longer in possession of a high refresh fee tune, then any distinction between these two cards will most likely be misplaced fully anyway. What&#8217;s more, I&#8217;m no longer obvious even I would possibly perchance perchance perchance discern the distinction between 100fps and 110fps with out the lend a hand of a body fee counter, declare, so these taking part in video games at 1080p would doubtlessly be  sticking with the RTX 3060 Ti as a replacement of spending any further on the RTX 3070. </p>\n<h2>Nvidia RTX 3070 vs 3060 Ti: 1440p benchmarks</h2>\n<p>Indeed, it be only when we transfer as a lot as <strong>2560&#215;1440</strong> that the RTX 3070 begins to bear a clearer case for itself. But again, each cards are larger than able to taking part in video games on max settings at this resolution, and in most instances the RTX 3070 is out in entrance with a the same 10fps lead on the RTX 3060 Ti.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"A bar graph comparing the 1440p performance of the RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti.\" height=\"620\" src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2021/01/Nvidia-RTX-3070-vs-3060-ti-benchmarks-1440p.jpg\" width=\"1000\"></img></p>\n<p>There are mute a few instances the build the gap narrows, essentially in more most modern video games similar to Murderer&#8217;s Creed Valhalla and Cyberpunk 2077, but in diversified locations the RTX 3070&#8217;s lead is considerable plainer. All over again, it be no longer going you can witness considerable of a distinction between the two cards within the rapid term with out the lend a hand of a high refresh fee tune, as even the RTX 3060 Ti can attain a soft practical of 60fps in even on the present time&#8217;s most traumatic video games &#8211; and that entails Cyberpunk 2077 when you allow Nvidia&#8217;s DLSS tech. </p>\n<p>Finally, even when, the RTX 3070 will likely supply more future-proofing than the RTX 3060 Ti for Extremely quality fiends, especially by ass<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a>ment of staying firmly above the 60fps line. With video games similar to Murderer&#8217;s Creed Valhalla and Total Battle: Three Kingdoms already pushing the RTX 3060 Ti finest below 60fps on max settings, these numbers are only susceptible to drop further as video games uncover progressively more traumatic. The further horsepower afforded by the RTX 3070, on the diversified hand, will virtually with out a doubt can again you to address it up taking part in video games at 60fps on max settings for a miniature bit whereas longer &#8211; even when somewhat how for a ways longer is sophisticated to express provided that Valhalla mute has its shimmering portion of dips below the 60fps trace. </p>\n<p>Indubitably, that is no longer to express the RTX 3060 Ti will change into fully defunct in a 300 and sixty five days or two. Indeed, whenever you are joyful dropping the settings down to Excessive at 1440p, the RTX 3060 Ti would possibly perchance perchance furthermore mute mute be in a location to hit well in scheme over 60fps for a truly long time but. With averages of 86fps in Total Battle: Three Kingdoms on Excessive, besides as 68fps in Murderer&#8217;s Creed Valhalla and 81fps in Metro Exodus, the RTX 3060 Ti mute has larger than ample horsepower left to play video games at 1440p for a lot of years to strategy. </p>\n<h2>Nvidia RTX 3070 vs 3060 Ti: 4K benchmarks</h2>\n<p>On the opposite hand, if it be taking part in video games at <strong>3840&#215;2160</strong> that is more your win, then the RTX 3070 is with out a doubt the disagreeable winner here. As you would possibly perchance perchance perchance furthermore witness below, the RTX 3060 Ti puts up a slightly respectable fight at 4K, hitting around 60fps on Medium settings in virtually all of on the present time&#8217;s mountainous video games (attach Cyberpunk 2077, obviously). That is slightly finest going for a card of this calibre, especially will bear to you judge that finest a few years ago you&#8217;d bear had to pay larger than double what the RTX 3060 Ti for the time being expenses to uncover the identical form of performance.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"A bar graph comparing the 4K performance of the RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti.\" height=\"620\" src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2021/01/Nvidia-RTX-3070-vs-3060-ti-benchmarks-4K.jpg\" width=\"1000\"></img></p>\n<p>On the opposite hand, if it be only finest about managed a soft 60fps on Medium now, it doubtlessly obtained&#8217;t be long ahead of you are pressured to knock issues down to Low with the RTX 3060 Ti, and no one wants that, enact they? At that time, you would possibly perchance perchance perchance furthermore besides ride lend a hand to taking part in video games at 2560&#215;1440 with considerable prettier-taking a gaze graphics. </p>\n<p>The RTX 3070, on the diversified hand, is s<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a>ificantly better geared up for taking part in video games at 4K. All over again, newer titles similar to Murderer&#8217;s Creed Valhalla and Cyberpunk 2077 mute effect somewhat the stress on it at this resolution (even when Cyberpunk 2077 does as a minimum bear DLSS give a enhance to to again bump up the body fee a miniature bit), but older video games are all true up there across the 70fps trace. Raise the usual environment to Excessive and you&#8217;re taking a gaze at a soft 60fps in masses of video games, too &#8211; or increased whenever you allow DLSS give a enhance to. </p>\n<p>The RTX 3060 Ti advantages from DLSS, too, obviously. Indeed, in Shadow Of The Tomb Raider, it can hit a ambitious practical of 64fps on Absolute best at 4K with DLSS switched on, besides as a truly generous 62fps on Excessive in Closing Delusion XV. Monster Hunter: World&#8217;s DLSS give a enhance to permits the RTX 3060 Ti to push as a lot as Excessive, too, hitting a median of 73fps. They&#8217;re spectacular figures, to bear obvious, but unless the sequence of DLSS video games grows substantially over the subsequent couple of years, it be a ways more likely that you shall be taking part in video games on Medium or Low settings given its most modern performance capabilities in video games in without a DLSS give a enhance to.</p>\n<h2>Nvidia RTX 3070 vs 3060 Ti: conclusion</h2>\n<p>All in all, I reckon that unless you are dreary scheme on taking part in video games at max settings the entire time, then the RTX 3060 Ti is with out a doubt the cardboard to ride for here. At £369 / $399, it be somewhat somewhat more cost-effective than the £469 / $499 RTX 3070 (or as a minimum they would perchance perchance furthermore mute be as soon as prices and stock ranges strategy lend a hand to traditional), and you are mute getting 60fps+ speeds at each 1080p and 1440p in virtually all of on the present time&#8217;s largest PC video games. </p>\n<p>Plus, unless you are in particular sensitive to body fee speeds over 60fps, I&#8217;m no longer obvious you are actually going to witness the distinction between these two cards when you are into the geographical regions of hitting 80-100fps. I with out a doubt can&#8217;t distinguish between these forms of body charges with out the lend a hand of a body fee counter, so you would possibly perchance besides attach yourself some money within the strategy and effect the further £100 / $100 in opposition to one thing else on your PC luxuriate in a capable 1TB SSD.</p>\n<p>The RTX 3070 is price pondering whenever you are going to be taking part in video games at 4K, obviously, and it would possibly perchance perchance perchance perchance furthermore be my high Nvidia advice for taking part in video games on ultrawide gaming displays, too. For these with standard 1080p or 1440p displays, even when, the RTX 3060 Ti affords larger than ample performance here, and is susceptible to protect you going at high body charges for a few years to strategy. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>For more GPU comparisons ascertain out: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nvidia GTX 1650 vs 1050 Ti</li>\n<li>Nvidia GTX 1650 vs 1060</li>\n<li>Nvidia GTX 1650 vs AMD RX 570</li>\n<li>Nvidia GTX 1660 vs 1060</li>\n<li>Nvidia GTX 1660 vs 1660 Good</li>\n<li>Nvidia GTX 1660 vs 1660 Ti</li>\n<li>Nvidia GTX 1660 Good vs 1060</li>\n<li>Nvidia GTX 1660 Good vs 1660 Ti</li>\n<li>Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti vs 1060</li>\n<li>Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti vs 1070</li>\n<li>Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti vs RTX 2060</li>\n<li>Nvidia RTX 2060 vs GTX 1060</li>\n<li>Nvidia RTX 2060 vs 2060 Good vs AMD RX 5700 vs RX 5700 XT</li>\n<li>Nvidia RTX 2070 vs 2070 Good vs AMD RX 5700 XT</li>\n<li>Nvidia RTX 2070 Good vs 2080 Good</li>\n<li>Nvidia RTX 2080 vs GTX 1080</li>\n<li>Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti vs GTX 1080 Ti</li>\n<li>Nvidia RTX 3080 vs 2080 vs 2080 Good</li>\n<li>Nvidia RTX 3080 vs 2080 Ti\n</li>\n<li>AMD RX 5600 XT vs RX 5700</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote></div>\n</p></div>\n","title":"Nvidia RTX 3070 vs 3060 Ti: how do they compare?","date":"January 26, 2021","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"nvidia-rtx-3070-vs-3060-ti:-how-do-they-compare?","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='400'%20height='248'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20248'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'%3e%3cpath%20d='M232%20112v88l-1-74V52h-17l-1%2074v74h-8V49h-18v19l-9-1h-9v133h-9V65h-17v136l-1-68V65h-17l-1%2067v68h-8V60H99v141l-1-61V79H80v121h-8l-1-74V53H54v14H36l-1%2066v67h-6c-5%200-6%200-2%201h4v7l1%208v-15h44v7l1%208v-15h43v7l1%208v-15h44v7l1%208v-15h43v7l1%208v-15h132v7l1%208v-15h43v15l1-8%201-7-3-1h-3V100h-17v101l-1-45v-44h-18v88h-8V69h-17v131l-1-55V91h-18v109h-8l-1-49v-48h-17v98l-1-48v-47h-9l-8%201-1%2046v47h-8V26l-9-1h-8v87'%20fill='%23d3d3d3'%20fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e","aspectRatio":1.6129032258064515,"src":"/static/ac0bcac83144be81da9ca8009f14e638/724c8/24487-nvidia-rtx-3070-vs-3060-ti-how-do-they-compare.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ac0bcac83144be81da9ca8009f14e638/84d81/24487-nvidia-rtx-3070-vs-3060-ti-how-do-they-compare.jpg 250w,\n/static/ac0bcac83144be81da9ca8009f14e638/f0719/24487-nvidia-rtx-3070-vs-3060-ti-how-do-they-compare.jpg 500w,\n/static/ac0bcac83144be81da9ca8009f14e638/724c8/24487-nvidia-rtx-3070-vs-3060-ti-how-do-they-compare.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}}}}},"previous":{"uri":"/2021/01/26/this-1000-ring-lets-you-propose-the-skyrim-way/","title":"This $1000 ring lets you propose the Skyrim way"},"next":{"uri":"/2021/01/26/the-electronic-wireless-show-podcast-episode-125-the-best-sneakings-in-games-special/","title":"The Electronic Wireless Show podcast episode 125: the best sneakings in games special"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyNDQ4Nw==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyNDQ4Mg==","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoyNDQ5Mw=="}},"staticQueryHashes":["104267996","1682016598","848497233"]}
