Regrettably, the aim became as soon as quietly scrapped, but newly unearthed correspondence from Nintendo has at last confirmed why.</p>\n<p>First, though, a runt little bit of historic past; when Banjo-Kazooie released in 1998, gamers managing to 100% the sport had been treated to a special secret ending showing Banjo gaining access to three previously sealed-off areas &#8211; a mysterious risen island in Adore Trove Cove, a frozen ice collapse Freezeezy Height, and a sealed cliffside doorway in Gobi&#8217;s Valley. Alternatively, in spite of these tantalising teases, all three areas remained stubbornly inaccessible and it wasn&#8217;t till about a months after start that developer Rare supplied a proof.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The entire secret stuff can handiest be reached when playing Banjo-Tooie, the planned (and naturally higher) sequel to Banjo-Kazooie,&#8221; it wrote on its web roar, as documented by RareGamer. &#8220;Even as playing &#8216;Tooie, that you just would be capable to be ready to reach attend to &#8216;Kazooie and take dangle of the hidden goodies, earlier than spiriting them away into the sequel where they&#8217;re going to be place to correct use.&#8221;</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" data-youtube=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zHA-X1SzvyE?enablejsapi=1\" width=\"1280\"></iframe>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Rare by no manner officially supplied how this mechanism would work in functional terms, but an uncovered patent submitting shed a runt bit more light on the topic, explaining gamers would need to divulge a supported game cartridge when introduced on, then swap it for a 2d one, which would read and react to info retained in the console&#8217;s reminiscence.</p>\n<p>The disaster became as soon as, when Banjo-Tooie at last arrived in 2000, the promised inter-game connectivity (identified as Dwell &#8216;N&#8217; Swop) became as soon as nowhere to be stumbled on. Nor did it flip up in Donkey Kong 64, Conker, Jet Force Gemini, and Supreme Darkish, as Rare had firstly planned.</p>\n<p>Over time, people of the long-established construction group personal hinted Dwell &#8216;N&#8217; Swop became as soon as at last dropped at the query of Nintendo, but an email now shared by Rare utility developer Paul Machacek (as received by RareGamer) has laid out the explicit reasons for the company&#8217;s anxiousness when it comes to the aim, this time straight from the source.</p>\n<p>As per the email, Nintendo&#8217;s director of technical toughen contacted Rare to query the removal of Dwell &#8216;N&#8217; Swop at some level of construction of Donkey Kong 64 &#8211; which became as soon as created alongside Banjo, with similar interconnectivity planned &#8211; due to the uncertainty the N64&#8217;s reminiscence would withhold info long adequate to create determined that the aim consistently labored as advertised. More severely, it had concerns about risk of hurt to consoles and game cartridges if a swap became as soon as made whereas the energy became as soon as on, including &#8220;overheating and&#8230;consumer security&#8221;.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">What a day for Dwell &#8216;N&#8217; Swop news!

I mediate a resolution equivalent to this may maybe withhold among the most earnings of tying the two video games together and personal minimal affect to the code.&#8221; And with that, Dwell &#8216;N&#8217; Swop became as soon as effectively no more. </p>\n<p>Thankfully, in spite of the aim&#8217;s eventual loss of life, Banjo-Kazooie&#8217;s Dwell &#8216;N&#8217; Swop secrets and systems haven&#8217;t been fully lost to time and Nintendo&#8217;s whims, with enterprising gamers having successfully stumbled on systems to obtain admission to them the use of cheats buried away in the sport&#8217;s code. And whereas it be a shame the professional manner of exploring them by no manner materialised, it be horny to know that, some 20 years later, we at last personal a definitive resolution why.</p>\n</section>\n</div>\n","title":"Unearthed Nintendo missive reveals why Banjo-Kazooie’s infamous Stop ‘N’ Swop feature was ditched","date":"January 26, 2021","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"unearthed-nintendo-missive-reveals-why-banjo-kazooie&#8217;s-infamous-stop-&#8216;n&#8217;-swop-feature-was-ditched","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='400'%20height='65'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%2065'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'%3e%3cpath%20d='M24%201C-11%2013-3%2064%2034%2064c13%200%2023-6%2029-17%204-8%204-21%200-28C56%204%2039-3%2024%201m52%2032l1%2031%201-31-1-32-1%2032M26%204a29%2029%200%201036%2036c1-3%201-3-3-3-4%201-4%201-4%205%200%202-1%203-3%203l-2%202c0%202-2%201-3-1-1-5-6-9-8-7-1%202%201%206%204%208v2l-1%202h-1l-3-6c-3-3-4-3-5-2l-2%202c-1-1-5%203-5%205%200%203-2%205-4%204-3%200-8-2-8-4v-9l4-1c5%200%208-2%206-4-2-1-2-1%201-2%204-2%209-8%209-10l1-2%201%202c0%204%209%202%2010-2%201-1%201-2%202-1l1-1c-1-2%200-2%201-3%205-1%206-3%202-3-3%200-5-3-2-4l1-2h-4l-3%204c-2%201-2%202-1%203%202%200%201%203-1%206s-3%203-4-1c-1-3-1-3-3-1-3%202-4%200-4-4l3-4c2-1%204-3%204-6%200-2-7-3-12-1m171%2013c-9%204-13%2017-7%2025%207%209%2018%2010%2026%203%2015-12-1-36-19-28m41-1c-13%204-16%2021-6%2029%2011%209%2027%203%2028-11l1-3-10-1h-9v8h9l-3%202c-8%207-19-6-11-14%203-4%208-4%2011-1%202%202%203%202%206%200s4-3%201-5c-4-4-12-6-17-4M92%2033v16h24v-8h-7c-8%200-8%200-8-2%200-3%200-3%208-3h7v-8h-7c-8%200-8%200-8-2%200-3%200-3%208-3h7v-7H92v17m29-5c0%2013%201%2017%206%2019%207%204%2017%203%2022-2%202-3%203-3%203-16V16h-9v11c0%2013-1%2015-7%2015-5%200-6-2-6-15V16h-9v12m35%205v16h9v-5c0-8%203-8%207-1%202%205%203%206%207%206%206%200%206%200%202-7l-3-5%203-3c2-2%203-4%203-7%200-9-4-11-18-11h-10v17m113-9l-6%2017-3%208h5c4%200%205%200%206-2%200-3%201-3%207-3s6%200%207%203c1%202%202%202%205%202l5-1-6-16-5-16h-12l-3%208m30%208l1%2017h8V39l1-10%203%2010c6%2013%207%2013%2012%200l4-10v20h9V16h-6l-6%201-3%208-4%209-1-4-4-9-1-5h-13v16m43%201v16h24v-8h-8c-8%200-8%200-8-2%200-3%200-3%208-3h8v-7l-8-1c-8%200-8%200-8-2s1-3%208-3h8v-7h-24v17m29%200v16h8v-5c0-6%200-6%202-6s3%201%205%206l3%205h10l-3-6-3-6%202-1c5-4%205-13%200-17-3-3-4-3-14-3h-10v17m-173-8c-5%206-1%2017%207%2017%205%200%208-4%208-9%200-6-3-10-8-10l-7%202'%20fill='%23d3d3d3'%20fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e","aspectRatio":6.097560975609756,"src":"/static/e9ba6a312cc9804339974a29921ab37c/30963/23493-unearthed-nintendo-missive-reveals-why-banjo-kazooies-infamous-stop-n-swop-feature-was-ditched.png","srcSet":"/static/e9ba6a312cc9804339974a29921ab37c/002c1/23493-unearthed-nintendo-missive-reveals-why-banjo-kazooies-infamous-stop-n-swop-feature-was-ditched.png 250w,\n/static/e9ba6a312cc9804339974a29921ab37c/53f65/23493-unearthed-nintendo-missive-reveals-why-banjo-kazooies-infamous-stop-n-swop-feature-was-ditched.png 500w,\n/static/e9ba6a312cc9804339974a29921ab37c/30963/23493-unearthed-nintendo-missive-reveals-why-banjo-kazooies-infamous-stop-n-swop-feature-was-ditched.png 565w","sizes":"(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px"}}}}}},"previous":{"uri":"/2021/01/26/gta-online-publisher-smacks-down-another-cheat-seller/","title":"GTA Online publisher smacks down another cheat seller"},"next":{"uri":"/2021/01/26/mario-kart-tours-cat-tour-goes-live-today-teases-purrticularly-cute-new-character/","title":"Mario Kart Tour’s Cat Tour Goes Live Today, Teases “Purrticularly Cute” New Character"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyMzQ5Mw==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyMzY1OA==","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoyMzMxMA=="}},"staticQueryHashes":["104267996","1682016598","848497233"]}
