Dick Wolf’s One Chicago/Legislation &#038; Command: Special Victims Unit, assorted (2014)</h2>\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>When Dick Wolf living up shop in Chicago at Cinespace Film Studios, he did so with every intention of getting current crossovers. <span><em>Chicago Fire</em></span><em> </em>sparked <span><em>Chicago P.D.</em></span>, which gave birth to <span><em>Chicago Med</em></span> (<span><em>Chicago Justice</em></span>’s Unusual York ties indirectly price it a 2d season of 2nd City-based mostly totally reviews), and the whole a mountainous change of first responders work together loyal as they enact in exact lifestyles. (No no longer as much as, based mostly totally on Wolf’s rose-tinted ogle of Chicago emergency services and products.) And on account of Wolf and his frequent collaborator Warren Leight can’t relief themselves, there salvage additionally been about a crossovers with <em>Legislation &#038; Command: Special Victims Unit</em> (now the longest-working primetime are living-motion procedural). The inaugural <em>SVU</em>/<em>Chicago</em> crossover spanned two nights in 2014, beginning with <em>Chicago Fire</em>’s “No one Touches One thing else,” which gave means to <em>SVU’</em>s “Chicago Crossover,” and concluded with <em>Chicago P.D.</em>’s “They’ll Indulge in To Hurry Via Me,” as Chicago law enforcement officers Voight (Jason Beghe), Lindsay (Sophia Bush), and Halstead (Jesse Lee Soffer) discontinue up on Detective Benson’s (Mariska Hargitay) turf when they tune a shrimp one victim of sexual abuse photography to Unusual York City. The <em>Chicago</em> presentations (collectively/colloquially identified as One Chicago) helped Wolf pick over NBC’s Wednesday evening lineup, buoyed by ratings. Wolf’s crossovers salvage even made room for his <em>FBI </em>sequence, which airs on CBS. [Danette Chavez]</p>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>16 / 18</p>\n<div>\n<h2>15.

The X-Recordsdata/Cops, “X-Cops” (2000)</h2>\n</p>\n<div>\n<p>One amongst the sci-fi sequence’ funniest episodes is additionally one in every of its most innovative. A crossover of two unlikely properties, <span>“X-Cops”</span> works totally on account of the lengths Vince Gilligan and his crew went to to be tremendous the episode felt extra love <em>Cops</em> than <span><em>The X-Recordsdata</em></span>. It begins with the <em>Cops</em> theme, makes use of <em>Cops</em>’ bumper shots, and rounds out the forged and crew with proper officers and alums of the reality sequence. It in fact works, too. After Mulder and Scully intersect with the law enforcement officers (and their movie crew), all of whom are investigating reports of a “monster,” the presence of in-world cameras casts our heroes in an totally current mild, with Mulder relishing the spotlight and Scully resisting it (unsurprising on both counts). Lots of the options aged in discovered-pictures terror—long, unbroken shots, improvisatory dialogue, obfuscated scares—are discovered right here, adding a brand current and welcome texture to the sequence’ monster-of-the-week structure. Not each person loves <em>The X-Recordsdata</em>’<em> </em>gimmicky episodes, but “X-Cops” is without recount one in every of the largest.

The sequence used to be praised for its depiction of a decrease-heart-class family, and the Conners were one in every of the final TV clans you’d demand to wicked paths with the high-society-adjoining Edina Monsoon (Jennifer Saunders) and Patsy Stone (Joanna Lumley) of <span><em>Fully Improbable</em></span>. Nonetheless that all changed when Barr had Roseanne salvage the lottery. The living model used to be broadly criticized (and totally invalidated on the discontinue of season 9), but no lower than it gave us the chance to appear at Roseanne salvage wasted with the <em>AbFab</em> ladies. Barr had purchased the rights to the cherished British comedy, with intentions of adapting it for American tv, and requested Saunders to support her craft a story that would possibly fuse the 2 worlds. The consequence used to be the season-9 Halloween episode, which begins with Roseanne and her sister, Jackie (Laurie Metcalf, peaceable doing sizable work on<span> <em>The Conners</em></span>), at a charity gala in Unusual York City and devolves into a <em>Rosemary’s Child </em>fever dream that includes <em>That Woman</em>’s Marlo Thomas. In 2018, <span>Saunders advised Graham Norton about her <em>Roseanne </em>journey</span>: “We were rather stressed. Nonetheless it used to be enjoyable.” That about sums up the viewing journey, too.
