In my gaze, I left her alone. The Regalia by default became as soon as a beautiful automotive, and I don’t must fix what ain’t been broke, as Cid would bid. The Regalia, love each and each of Noctis’ companions, even bought its personal “I gotta plod away for some time” subplot that compelled me to soar it using chocobos in each situation.</p>\n<figure contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt=\"undefined\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-height=\"1080\" data-id=\"tumkimauhtwgdybmu3cp\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommend-id=\"image://tumkimauhtwgdybmu3cp\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-width=\"1920\" draggable=\"false\">\n<div contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt=\"undefined\" data-hidecredit=\"false\" data-imagerights=\"fair-use\" data-syndicationrights=\"true\">\n<p><span></p>\n<div>\n<p><img alt=\"undefined\" data-alt=\"undefined\" data-anim-src=\"http://kotaku.com/\" data-chomp-id=\"tumkimauhtwgdybmu3cp\" data-expanded- data-format=\"jpg\" data- draggable=\"auto\"  src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"></img></p>\n</div>\n<p></span></p><figcaption>I shock what number of miles per gallon the Regalia gets.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot: Square Enix</figcaption></div>\n<p><span data-alt=\"undefined\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-height=\"1080\" data-id=\"tumkimauhtwgdybmu3cp\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommend-id=\"image://tumkimauhtwgdybmu3cp\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-width=\"1920\"></span></figure>\n<p>I loved that automotive, nonetheless didn’t tag how out of the ordinary I appreciated its strong, silent presence unless it became as soon as no extra, “death” in an fable formulation by a mixture of superior fortune, programming, and plight. </p>\n<p>The defining attribute of the Regalia is its capability to play typical <em>Ultimate Myth</em> song as you force around.

It wasn’t a magical automotive that spoke or cracked jokes love some <em>Ultimate Myth</em> version of KITT.
