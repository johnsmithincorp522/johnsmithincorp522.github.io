That contains what the developer calls “dual-actuality gameplay,” which you’ll perceive within the video above, gamers might per chance be traversing two planes of existence on the same time. It’s in fact an achievement on technical level, but this is able to per chance per chance simply preserve your eyes busy higher than your brain.</p>\n<p>The atmosphere, total with a soundtrack by Arkadiusz Reikowski and Akira Yamaoka (of <em>Silent Hill</em> standing), is believed to be one of <em>The Medium’s</em> greatest strengths. Haunting piano melodies and mounted camera angles are extinct to wonderful kind as you chase prolonged corridors of gentle buildings and dense, seemingly unending forests. But with mounted camera angles also comes some clunky motion: On event when the camera perspective adjustments, I’m spinning Marianne in circles to reorient the joystick relative to the original viewing perspective. It in most cases is a bit jarring.</p>\n<p>Check up on the video above for a watch at how the recreation looks and runs on an Xbox Sequence X. Whenever you’re a Sport Circulation subscriber shopping for a original dismay recreation, it&#8217;ll’t anguish to present <em>The Medium</em> a pace to hunt if it’s your cup of tea. It’s value it for the soundtrack alone.</p>\n</div>\n","title":"A Video Look At The Medium, The First Next-Gen-Only Game On Xbox","date":"January 27, 2021","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"a-video-look-at-the-medium,-the-first-next-gen-only-game-on-xbox","localFile":{"childImageSharp":null}}}},"previous":{"uri":"/2021/01/27/upcoming-tomb-raider-anime-will-continue-the-reboot-trilogy-story/","title":"Upcoming Tomb Raider anime will continue the reboot trilogy story"},"next":{"uri":"/2021/01/27/tencent-acquires-a-minority-stake-in-life-is-strange-developer-dontnod/","title":"Tencent acquires a minority stake in Life is Strange developer Dontnod"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyNTU0NQ==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyNTU0OA==","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoyNTU0Mg=="}},"staticQueryHashes":["104267996","1682016598","848497233"]}
