It is miles a top rate offering aimed squarely at gamers, and so prices a tiny more than a accepted router, but boasts more parts. The most practical probably knowledge is that it does pack the most contemporary tech into its plane-inspired make, and that functions supporting the brand new Wi-Fi 6 normal. </p>\n<div>\n<p>Netgear Nighthawk XR1000 specs</p>\n<p><strong>CPU: </strong>1.5 GHz Triple-core<strong><br /></br><br />\nRAM: </strong> 512 MB<br /></br><strong>WAN: </strong>1x Gigabit ethernet<br /></br><strong>LAN: </strong> 4x Gigabit ethernet<br /></br><strong>Wi-Fi: </strong> AX5400 (as much as 4.8Gbps in 5GHz band)<br /></br><strong>Security: </strong> WPA3<br /></br><strong>Tag: </strong> $349 (£330)</p>\n</div>\n<p>Even the appropriate routers aren&#8217;t historically heavy objects, but when getting the XR1000 Nighthawk out of its box its lack of weight is totally noticeable. Esteem Netgear forgot to build any electronics internal it, and it runs off the ability of cosmic unusual air and about a little screws.</p>\n<p>There may be one thing in there despite the incontrovertible fact that, we checked. You win a triple-core processor working at 1.5GHz, with 512MB RAM and 256MB of flash storage. There’s Wi-Fi 6 on board, hitting a theoretical most escape of 4.8GBps in the 5GHz band, so that you just win toys relish beamforming (on both channels), MU-MIMO, and OFDMA to ship the four available in the market streams where they prefer to light be. Four aerials jog in at properly spaced intervals so that they’re not too crowded. </p>\n<p>There’s a button on the front that turns the Wi-Fi on and off, and but any other for WPS. The build LEDs are arranged in a V alongside the vertices of a faceted flooring that, we divulge, does peek a tiny bit bit relish an F117 Nighthawk, in the occasion you squint a tiny and are feeling namely charitable. Presumably, it’s sophisticated to area on radar, following Pyotr Ufimtsev’s theories on edges, but for stride, the whole thing is shaded with darkish purple accents, flat and large, and fair most practical probably for being positioned on a shelf and forgotten about.</p>\n<p>Round the lend a hand, you’ll win the normal connectors: there are five gigabit ethernet sockets—one WAN and 4 LAN—a USB 3.0 port, the on/off switch, strength socket, and a tiny bit reset button. This port assortment looks a tiny bit mean—peek at the RT-AX88U or XR700 in converse for you more, or sooner, ports. It’s marketed as a gaming router, then again, so has been des<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a>ed to cease one thing—win internets to your PC as hasty as that you just may per chance take into consideration, and cease it wirelessly. Fortunately, it does this rather neatly.</p>\n<p>Setup is barely straightforward, bright the username and password printed on the router, a QR code, and the Netgear app to your smartphone. There are some comically clear like a flash-commence up playing cards integrated in the box too, in a few languages. </p>\n<figure data-bordeaux-image-check=\"\">\n<div>\n<p><picture><source alt=\"Netgear Nighthawk XR1000\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cEZ7xQby5nis4ZhEJ2YNTo.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cEZ7xQby5nis4ZhEJ2YNTo.jpg\" data- onerror=\"if(this.src &#038;&#038; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\"  type=\"image/webp\"></source><source alt=\"Netgear Nighthawk XR1000\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cEZ7xQby5nis4ZhEJ2YNTo.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cEZ7xQby5nis4ZhEJ2YNTo.jpg\" data- onerror=\"if(this.src &#038;&#038; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\"  type=\"image/jpeg\"></source><img alt=\"Netgear Nighthawk XR1000\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cEZ7xQby5nis4ZhEJ2YNTo.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cEZ7xQby5nis4ZhEJ2YNTo.jpg\" data- onerror=\"if(this.src &#038;&#038; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\"  src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\"></img></picture></p>\n</div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\"><span itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The router runs Duma OS 3, an OS des<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a>ed for gaming routers. Likely it’s the dull processor on the XR1000, but we discovered it dull to answer, leaving us with a spinning circle for nearly 10 seconds on first logging in, then with a ‘please wait’ message for four or five seconds at any time when we modified between menu alternatives. The Nighthawk AX80, which doesn’t exercise Duma, is a long way snappier to answer, but then it has a quad-core 1.8GHz CPU. Updating settings, too, is a dull direction of, despite the incontrovertible fact that we suspect this would per chance well also be a characteristic of Wi-Fi routers as a whole rather than one thing direct to this one.</p>\n<p>Whereas you’ve obtained a .cfg file from a outdated router, you may per chance upload it and straight away clone your erstwhile win entry to point (despite the incontrovertible fact that this failed at any time when we tried it), but even in the occasion you’re doing it by hand, setup is solely a topic of about a passwords and deciding which of the router’s parts you’d prefer to exercise. </p>\n<p>It supports Dapper Connect, where your 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks seem as one, and devices fight it out for which band they win to exercise with the router des<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a> officiating. It’s off by default, as are Wi-Fi 6 parts much like OFDMA, so it would maybe per chance pay to a dig by the settings to flip on the whole bells and whistles. Whereas you like shut to retain your bands separate, you may per chance title them for my fragment, give them irregular passwords, and web web page whether or not they’re hidden.</p>\n<figure data-bordeaux-image-check=\"\">\n<div>\n<p><picture><source alt=\"Netgear Nighthawk XR1000\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F3LBCtuWF5Gdme3uqV3pa.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F3LBCtuWF5Gdme3uqV3pa.jpg\" data- onerror=\"if(this.src &#038;&#038; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\"  type=\"image/webp\"></source><source alt=\"Netgear Nighthawk XR1000\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F3LBCtuWF5Gdme3uqV3pa.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F3LBCtuWF5Gdme3uqV3pa.jpg\" data- onerror=\"if(this.src &#038;&#038; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\"  type=\"image/jpeg\"></source><img alt=\"Netgear Nighthawk XR1000\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F3LBCtuWF5Gdme3uqV3pa.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F3LBCtuWF5Gdme3uqV3pa.jpg\" data- onerror=\"if(this.src &#038;&#038; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\"  src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\"></img></picture></p>\n</div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\"><span itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Security, as is the case with all Netgear Nighthawk (and Orbi Mesh) routers this point to day, is handled by the BitDefender-powered Netgear Armor. You win a month’s free trial, but after that, it’s $69.99 a 365 days. </p>\n<p>We despise this. It feels a tiny bit relish you may per chance very neatly be being held to ransom, having spent so noteworthy on a quality router from a revered imprint. ‘Tremendous router,’ it says. ‘Disgrace if one thing had been to happen to it.’ </p>\n<p>The router isn’t precisely shy with out it either, its Wi-Fi encrypted with WPA3 despite the whole lot. Netgear Armor is a whole equipment despite the incontrovertible fact that, its apps keeping an countless different of cellular devices, in conjunction with an encrypted VPN with 200MB of knowledge transfer per day, enabling a long way away locking and wiping of obliging devices (apart from Apple ones) and notifications about suspicious devices attempting to be part of the community. Whereas you’re thinking about community safety, it’s effective to bear. Even so, we’ve been happily gaming away for years on a Nighthawk router with out it and not had any complications.</p>\n<p>One thing the router’s marketing and marketing is extraordinarily fervent to snarl you is that this would per chance lower your ping. Within the direct world, we saw tiny distinction from our every day router, the AX80. Likely any individual replacing an older router, or one from a undeniable imprint, would maybe per chance per chance leer more distinction. </p>\n<figure data-bordeaux-image-check=\"\">\n<div>\n<p><picture><source alt=\"Netgear Nighthawk XR1000\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f4ywdRn2uEgwToPyzATYG.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f4ywdRn2uEgwToPyzATYG.jpg\" data- onerror=\"if(this.src &#038;&#038; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\"  type=\"image/webp\"></source><source alt=\"Netgear Nighthawk XR1000\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f4ywdRn2uEgwToPyzATYG.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f4ywdRn2uEgwToPyzATYG.jpg\" data- onerror=\"if(this.src &#038;&#038; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\"  type=\"image/jpeg\"></source><img alt=\"Netgear Nighthawk XR1000\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f4ywdRn2uEgwToPyzATYG.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f4ywdRn2uEgwToPyzATYG.jpg\" data- onerror=\"if(this.src &#038;&#038; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\"  src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg\"></img></picture></p>\n</div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\"><span itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>There may be artful GeoFilter des<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a> baked into Duma OS to win the closest, or quickest, game server, which hundreds of gamers bear discovered purposeful. It is potentially a tiny more purposeful for the console lot, that does not continuously win noteworthy exclaim in how they join, where we on the whole win to desire servers. Silent, or not it&#8217;s a long way a dapper characteristic that I&#8217;d rather bear on the off likelihood it will most definitely be purposeful at some point soon. </p>\n<p>On to efficiency. Copying 7GB of video files to a community-connected SSD over the 5GHz Wi-Fi 6 connection with a 2&#215;2 client gave the same speeds to a wired connection, peaking at over 100MB/s but falling as tiny as 1MB/s—you’ll need the quickest 4&#215;4 160MHz networking playing cards to win essentially the most out of this router.</p>\n<p>Whereas we’d bear preferred to peek more in the manner of suitable hardware parts much like 2.5Gb Ethernet ports and a pair of USBs on a router so dedicated to bustle, we bear got to confess here&#8217;s a fairly nippy mannequin. Whereas the transfer speeds we saw weren’t considerably higher than a wired connection, the ability to win a theoretical 4.8Gbps over Wi-Fi is to not be sniffed at, and the steadiness of the connection in a suburban home from the ‘90s used to be aesthetic, with pudgy s<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a>al carried out by partitions and strolling 30m away. </p>\n<p>We’d be inclined to peek at other Netgear merchandise, namely the XR700 or RT-AX88U, over this one as they&#8217;ve higher bodily ports.
