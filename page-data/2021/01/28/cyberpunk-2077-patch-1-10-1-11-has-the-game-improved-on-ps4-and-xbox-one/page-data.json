And here&#8217;s important because of we&#8217;ve fully no query in anyway that crashes will also be rectified and system faults eliminated, nonetheless the typical self-discipline is this: does remaining-gen hardware hang the horsepower to assert a consistent stage of efficiency that&#8217;s great nearer to the goal 30fps? Efficiency diagnosis of version 1.10 supplies us optimism in some respects, nonetheless there would possibly perhaps be light a mountain to climb.</p>\n<p>Pointless to assert, version 1.10 has since been updated with patch 1.11, which in reality delivers a hotfix replace to fair a pair of bugs, nonetheless the main optimisation and balance push presented memory management enhancements, and addressed a big array of bugs. What&#8217;s odd are the platform-teach optimisations: there would possibly perhaps be talk of crowd optimisation for PS4 Pro and PlayStation 5, nonetheless definitely the horrible PS4 could perhaps additionally fair light pork up too? And why wouldn&#8217;t these optimisations additionally pork up the difficulty for Xbox One customers. For its phase, the Microsoft platform observed memory management modifications, namely round personality introduction, mirrors, camera scanning and hundreds extra. </p>\n<p>Curiously though, our assessments counsel that there are extra enhancements &#8211; and because it be the vanilla PS4 and Xbox One which <em>undoubtedly</em> desire a amount of work, these are the platforms we at the origin chose to verify out. Something we can file straight away: we did now not anticipate the sport crash, or lock, or fall motivate to the front dwell at all. That is no longer to assert we did now not hit upon system faults and bugs &#8211; we surely did &#8211; nonetheless cleansing up crashing concerns and turning in a extra obtain expertise is likely the amount 1 goal of CD Projekt RED. Clearly, our discovering out is proscribed to a tiny dwelling of the sport, nonetheless we would chalk this up as a critical step forward for the sport. </p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" data-youtube=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Isv9AAK36xQ?enablejsapi=1\" width=\"1280\"></iframe>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div><figcaption>\n<p>Cyberpunk 2077 &#8211; the say of play in terms of efficiency, balance and system faults consistent with the 1.10/1.11 code.</p>\n</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Taking part in on the regular PlayStation 4, we additionally well-known a pair of enhancements that don&#8217;t appear to had been published within the patch notes. Initially, image quality appears to be like to be noticeably improved. Even with the compressed video you&#8217;re going to anticipate on this page, the enhance to clarity here could perhaps additionally fair light be self-evident &#8211; almost definitely CDPR has tweaked the temporal anti-aliasing factor of the renderer, tweaked submit-TAA sharpening or dialled motivate the depth of the submit-processing pipeline. Regardless, it does gawk cleaner. Getting a lock on native resolution on this sport is a self-discipline owing to how impulsively pixel counts shift, nonetheless our impression is that right rendering resolution remains unchanged from the commence code &#8211; Cyberpunk 2077 fair looks cleaner.</p>\n<p>In grab scenarios, we additionally well-known improved efficiency too on PS4 &#8211; something up to 5 or six frames per 2nd, which is awfully a feat, a critical soar in percentage terms. Curiously, we observed this occurring in scenarios adore the vehicle shoot-out with the scavengers after the main mission &#8211; the place CDPR&#8217;s talked about crowd system optimisation is no longer going to hang made any influence in anyway. Again, image quality remains clearer and the suite of effects remains the identical, so here&#8217;s qualified development. Nonetheless it be sure that we&#8217;re light some manner off an generous expertise. Other areas of the sport in most cases streak the identical as they did sooner than and efficiency concerns remain. In frenzied shoot-outs, it be light conceivable for Cyberpunk 2077 to dip under 20fps on PlayStation 4, whereas hitching from streaming connected concerns is light negate. It be light very sophisticated to counsel this sport to customers of the most in sort console of the rest generation.</p>\n<p>The place does version 1.10 stride away the Xbox One S? Properly, it looks adore the enchancment to image clarity seen on PlayStation 4 applies to the vanilla Xbox One too, nonetheless previous the enhancements to general balance, all of our take a look at clips published no noticeable enhance to efficiency when in contrast to patch 1.02. The in most cases extended stutters are long gone, the enhancements in balance are additionally negate, nonetheless the right manner the sport plays out remains as unsatisfactory as it modified into once beforehand. Xbox is additionally the place I skilled one in particular main glitch &#8211; and an self-discipline I would adore to anticipate CDPR take care of is the manner that taking part in on one roughly Xbox can influence the expertise if you swap to one other. As an illustration, if you play on Sequence X in quality mode, switching over to Xbox One or Xbox One X sees frame-charges fall to round 15fps. This can handiest be fully resolved by wiping all sport saves from affected Xboxes. I will stride away you to see the video to anticipate one of the numerous uncommon bugs and odd system faults I encountered on both platforms. </p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" data-youtube=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mVWJPYKCMco?enablejsapi=1\" width=\"1280\"></iframe>\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div><figcaption>\n<p>Our overview of the total rest-gen variations of Cyberpunk 2077, running on 1.04 code &#8211; and no longer in particular well on any platform.</p>\n</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A lot like our work on The Witcher 3, we enact purpose to chart the event of Cyberpunk 2077&#8217;s diverse patches and upgrades at some stage in time, so having done work on the horrible machines, our look moves over to enhanced consoles. In our preliminary assessments, PS4 Pro &#8211; whereas light possessing grave concerns in some scenarios &#8211; perceived to be the seize of the bunch when it came to taking part within the sport on remaining generation systems. Nonetheless, impressions to this point counsel that previous balance enhancements, it be light the identical expertise general &#8211; our take a look at cases animated crowds (an dwelling singled out by CDPR as the main focal point for optimisation work in 1.10) showed inconclusive results, and positively no sport-altering enchancment. </p>\n<p>In the crash, our takeaway from Cyberpunk 2077 patch 1.10 &#8211; and indeed 1.11 &#8211; is moderately uncomplicated. Steps had been taken to keep away with sport crashes and to pork up balance general &#8211; the roughly traditional enchancment that need to seize precedence, nonetheless whereas there are some enhancements to the manner the sport runs (on horrible PS4 at least), it doesn&#8217;t respond the anticipate we had after we observed the very first demo: is it undoubtedly conceivable to streak this with out problems on a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One? On the PS4 facet, there would possibly perhaps be the sense that some qualified enhancements had been made &#8211; nonetheless at the identical time, if there had been traditional optimisations here, I would hang expected to anticipate some roughly enchancment on the Pro facet too. </p>\n<p>In accordance with prior PR, CDPR&#8217;s des<a href=\"https://gamingorigin.cf\" target=\"_blank\">Gaming Origin</a> is to assert one other main patch in February, so we will be reporting motivate on that as and when the upgrade arrives.</p>\n</section>\n</div>\n","title":"Cyberpunk 2077 patch 1.10/1.11 – has the game improved on PS4 and Xbox One?","date":"January 28, 2021","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"cyberpunk-2077-patch-110/1.11-&#8211;-has-the-game-improved-on-ps4-and-xbox-one?","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='400'%20height='65'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%2065'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'%3e%3cpath%20d='M24%201C-11%2013-3%2064%2034%2064c13%200%2023-6%2029-17%204-8%204-21%200-28C56%204%2039-3%2024%201m52%2032l1%2031%201-31-1-32-1%2032M26%204a29%2029%200%201036%2036c1-3%201-3-3-3-4%201-4%201-4%205%200%202-1%203-3%203l-2%202c0%202-2%201-3-1-1-5-6-9-8-7-1%202%201%206%204%208v2l-1%202h-1l-3-6c-3-3-4-3-5-2l-2%202c-1-1-5%203-5%205%200%203-2%205-4%204-3%200-8-2-8-4v-9l4-1c5%200%208-2%206-4-2-1-2-1%201-2%204-2%209-8%209-10l1-2%201%202c0%204%209%202%2010-2%201-1%201-2%202-1l1-1c-1-2%200-2%201-3%205-1%206-3%202-3-3%200-5-3-2-4l1-2h-4l-3%204c-2%201-2%202-1%203%202%200%201%203-1%206s-3%203-4-1c-1-3-1-3-3-1-3%202-4%200-4-4l3-4c2-1%204-3%204-6%200-2-7-3-12-1m171%2013c-9%204-13%2017-7%2025%207%209%2018%2010%2026%203%2015-12-1-36-19-28m41-1c-13%204-16%2021-6%2029%2011%209%2027%203%2028-11l1-3-10-1h-9v8h9l-3%202c-8%207-19-6-11-14%203-4%208-4%2011-1%202%202%203%202%206%200s4-3%201-5c-4-4-12-6-17-4M92%2033v16h24v-8h-7c-8%200-8%200-8-2%200-3%200-3%208-3h7v-8h-7c-8%200-8%200-8-2%200-3%200-3%208-3h7v-7H92v17m29-5c0%2013%201%2017%206%2019%207%204%2017%203%2022-2%202-3%203-3%203-16V16h-9v11c0%2013-1%2015-7%2015-5%200-6-2-6-15V16h-9v12m35%205v16h9v-5c0-8%203-8%207-1%202%205%203%206%207%206%206%200%206%200%202-7l-3-5%203-3c2-2%203-4%203-7%200-9-4-11-18-11h-10v17m113-9l-6%2017-3%208h5c4%200%205%200%206-2%200-3%201-3%207-3s6%200%207%203c1%202%202%202%205%202l5-1-6-16-5-16h-12l-3%208m30%208l1%2017h8V39l1-10%203%2010c6%2013%207%2013%2012%200l4-10v20h9V16h-6l-6%201-3%208-4%209-1-4-4-9-1-5h-13v16m43%201v16h24v-8h-8c-8%200-8%200-8-2%200-3%200-3%208-3h8v-7l-8-1c-8%200-8%200-8-2s1-3%208-3h8v-7h-24v17m29%200v16h8v-5c0-6%200-6%202-6s3%201%205%206l3%205h10l-3-6-3-6%202-1c5-4%205-13%200-17-3-3-4-3-14-3h-10v17m-173-8c-5%206-1%2017%207%2017%205%200%208-4%208-9%200-6-3-10-8-10l-7%202'%20fill='%23d3d3d3'%20fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e","aspectRatio":6.097560975609756,"src":"/static/c1d38acecbcd6e5245c6918e3eed6f1e/30963/26121-cyberpunk-2077-patch-110-1-11-has-the-game-improved-on-ps4-and-xbox-one.png","srcSet":"/static/c1d38acecbcd6e5245c6918e3eed6f1e/002c1/26121-cyberpunk-2077-patch-110-1-11-has-the-game-improved-on-ps4-and-xbox-one.png 250w,\n/static/c1d38acecbcd6e5245c6918e3eed6f1e/53f65/26121-cyberpunk-2077-patch-110-1-11-has-the-game-improved-on-ps4-and-xbox-one.png 500w,\n/static/c1d38acecbcd6e5245c6918e3eed6f1e/30963/26121-cyberpunk-2077-patch-110-1-11-has-the-game-improved-on-ps4-and-xbox-one.png 565w","sizes":"(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px"}}}}}},"previous":{"uri":"/2021/01/28/whats-free-on-the-epic-games-store-right-now/","title":"What’s free on the Epic Games Store right now?"},"next":{"uri":"/2021/01/28/sonic-the-hedgehog-voice-actor-suggests-hes-leaving-the-role/","title":"Sonic the Hedgehog voice actor suggests he’s leaving the role"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyNjEyMQ==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyNjEzOQ==","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoyNjEyNA=="}},"staticQueryHashes":["104267996","1682016598","848497233"]}
